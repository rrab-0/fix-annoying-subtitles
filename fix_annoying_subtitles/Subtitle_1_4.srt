1
00:00:02,95 --> 00:00:05,08
Pre-Mor Enforcement
put out a bulletin last night

2
00:00:05,16 --> 00:00:06,91
for someone meeting Cassian's description.

3
00:00:07,00 --> 00:00:08,75
LUTHEN: <i>The bulletin</i>
<i>doesn't mention him by name.</i>

4
00:00:08,83 --> 00:00:10,66
<i>It says they're looking</i>
<i>for someone from Kenari.</i>

5
00:00:10,75 --> 00:00:13,33
SERGEANT MOSK: <i>Andor should be considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

6
00:00:13,41 --> 00:00:15,87
<i>He may not appear to be</i>
<i>a formidable opponent,</i>

7
00:00:15,95 --> 00:00:18,50
<i>but two of our men are dead</i>
<i>having made that mistake.</i>

8
00:00:18,58 --> 00:00:19,58
-Who are you?


9
00:00:19,66 --> 00:00:20,83
I know all about you.

10
00:00:20,91 --> 00:00:21,91
Yes, I want the box,

11
00:00:22,00 --> 00:00:24,12
and I'll leave with that
if it's all I can get.

12
00:00:24,20 --> 00:00:26,04
I know you killed two Corpos
at Morlana-One,

13
00:00:26,12 --> 00:00:27,54
and I know they're coming for you.

14
00:00:27,62 --> 00:00:29,45
Seems like such a waste
to let them have you.

15
00:00:29,54 --> 00:00:30,95
Waste of talent.

16
00:00:31,04 --> 00:00:32,54


17
00:00:32,62 --> 00:00:34,33
We have a warrant for Cassian Andor.

18
00:00:34,41 --> 00:00:35,91


19
00:00:36,25 --> 00:00:38,00
-Brace yourself.


20
00:00:38,08 --> 00:00:39,70
-Let's go!
-SOLDIER 1: There he is!

21
00:00:39,79 --> 00:00:43,12



22
00:00:43,20 --> 00:00:45,41

-How many are you?

23
00:00:45,50 --> 00:00:48,29
Twelve.  Fourteen.
 I swear.

24
00:00:48,37 --> 00:00:49,58
I'd like you to come with me.

25
00:00:49,66 --> 00:00:51,54
Why would I go anywhere with you?

26
00:00:51,62 --> 00:00:54,20
Don't you want to fight
these bastards for real?

27
00:00:55,83 --> 00:00:56,83


28
00:00:56,91 --> 00:00:58,12


29
00:00:58,66 --> 00:00:59,70


30
00:00:59,79 --> 00:01:01,62



31
00:01:02,29 --> 00:01:03,66


32
00:01:30,70 --> 00:01:34,54


33
00:02:05,66 --> 00:02:07,62


34
00:02:08,87 --> 00:02:10,20
-LUTHEN: There's a medpac.


35
00:02:10,29 --> 00:02:11,50
LUTHEN: Blue. Bright blue.

36
00:02:12,12 --> 00:02:13,20
The shelf behind you.

37
00:02:14,75 --> 00:02:16,29
Take hold of something.

38
00:02:16,37 --> 00:02:18,08
-Anyone behind us?
-Set for Aldhani.

39
00:02:18,16 --> 00:02:19,70
FONDOR DROID MOD: <i>Calculating for Aldhani.</i>

40
00:02:19,79 --> 00:02:21,83
CASSIAN: Are they coming?
LUTHEN: Do as I say.

41
00:02:22,41 --> 00:02:24,04
FONDOR DROID MOD: <i>Calculations complete.</i>

42
00:02:24,12 --> 00:02:26,25


43
00:02:26,33 --> 00:02:28,75



44
00:02:32,41 --> 00:02:33,66
What's powering this?

45
00:02:35,41 --> 00:02:37,16
I've been in a Fondor Haulcraft.

46
00:02:37,25 --> 00:02:38,58
I've flown them.

47
00:02:38,66 --> 00:02:40,00
Never seen one do that.

48
00:02:40,08 --> 00:02:42,50
Well, it's been a day of surprises
for all of us.

49
00:02:44,41 --> 00:02:45,83
You're bleeding on my floor.

50
00:02:45,91 --> 00:02:47,12
Fix your arm.

51
00:02:49,83 --> 00:02:50,83
What's Aldhani?

52
00:02:53,45 --> 00:02:54,54
That depends.

53
00:02:55,08 --> 00:02:57,87
I haven't agreed to do anything
but save my skin.

54
00:02:58,75 --> 00:03:02,12
Yeah, and here you are with your skin.

55
00:03:02,20 --> 00:03:03,25
CASSIAN: 

56
00:03:03,33 --> 00:03:05,33
-What's that?
-LUTHEN: Med nog.

57
00:03:05,83 --> 00:03:06,87
Just a sip.

58
00:03:10,79 --> 00:03:11,83


59
00:03:11,91 --> 00:03:13,04


60
00:03:15,04 --> 00:03:17,66
Perhaps you got alternatives
I'm not aware of.

61
00:03:17,75 --> 00:03:19,83
Seems to me you have two choices.

62
00:03:19,91 --> 00:03:22,41
Either I drop you somewhere
and you start running

63
00:03:23,50 --> 00:03:26,33
or you come with me
and help with something important.

64
00:03:26,41 --> 00:03:27,41


65
00:03:27,50 --> 00:03:31,29
And, of course, you could try
and kill me and take the ship.

66
00:03:31,95 --> 00:03:33,08


67
00:03:33,16 --> 00:03:35,50


68
00:03:35,58 --> 00:03:36,87
Define "important."

69
00:03:38,50 --> 00:03:41,41
Taking something of real value
from the Empire.

70
00:03:41,50 --> 00:03:44,54
 I don't need you to steal.

71
00:03:44,62 --> 00:03:47,04
Seeing how well you're doing on your own.

72
00:03:47,12 --> 00:03:48,58
I'll take the drop-off.

73
00:03:48,66 --> 00:03:50,83
LUTHEN: And do what? Continue as you are?

74
00:03:50,91 --> 00:03:52,50
They'll use the same rope to hang you

75
00:03:52,58 --> 00:03:54,91
whether it's for a plasma coil
or 20 million credits.

76
00:03:55,00 --> 00:03:57,25
I'm offering you everything you want,
all at once.

77
00:03:57,33 --> 00:03:58,87
What is "everything I want"?

78
00:03:59,54 --> 00:04:01,20
Since you know so much about me.

79
00:04:01,79 --> 00:04:04,25
To put a real stick
in the eye of the Empire

80
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:06,33
and get paid for it.

81
00:04:07,08 --> 00:04:09,37
 I wondered who you were.

82
00:04:10,25 --> 00:04:11,33
Who am I?

83
00:04:12,37 --> 00:04:15,83
Alliance, Sep, guerilla, Partisan Front.

84
00:04:15,91 --> 00:04:18,20
-One of them.
-Isn't it all the same?

85
00:04:18,29 --> 00:04:19,45
It is to me.

86
00:04:19,54 --> 00:04:20,75
So we agree.

87
00:04:20,83 --> 00:04:22,37
 No.

88
00:04:23,08 --> 00:04:25,04
I think it's all useless.

89
00:04:25,12 --> 00:04:27,83
Better to spit in their food
and steal their trinkets.

90
00:04:27,91 --> 00:04:29,20
It's better to live.

91
00:04:30,95 --> 00:04:33,29
Better to eat, sleep, do what you want.

92
00:04:33,37 --> 00:04:34,37
You don't know me.

93
00:04:35,79 --> 00:04:39,08
 I fought in Mimban when I was 16.

94
00:04:39,16 --> 00:04:40,20
Two years of it.

95
00:04:40,29 --> 00:04:42,33
Straight out of prison, into the mud.

96
00:04:42,41 --> 00:04:44,12
I'm one of 50 that survived.

97
00:04:46,20 --> 00:04:48,29
And who did it turn out we were fighting?

98
00:04:49,16 --> 00:04:51,12
 Ourselves.

99
00:04:52,25 --> 00:04:53,45
So, please...

100
00:04:56,16 --> 00:04:59,37
You were on the ground
in Mimban for six months.

101
00:05:00,33 --> 00:05:01,75
You came in as a cook.

102
00:05:03,79 --> 00:05:05,50
You lived because you ran.

103
00:05:07,75 --> 00:05:09,20
But you're right about one thing.

104
00:05:09,29 --> 00:05:11,37
The Empire had you fighting each other,

105
00:05:12,04 --> 00:05:13,95
which should make you
hate them all the more,

106
00:05:14,04 --> 00:05:15,58
and you do.

107
00:05:15,66 --> 00:05:16,87
I said I know you.

108
00:05:18,62 --> 00:05:21,83
I know the outside.
I know what people tell me when I ask.

109
00:05:22,75 --> 00:05:24,04
The rest, I imagine.

110
00:05:24,70 --> 00:05:26,12
I imagine your hate.

111
00:05:26,70 --> 00:05:29,83
I imagine that no matter
what you tell me or tell yourself,

112
00:05:29,91 --> 00:05:32,62
you'll ultimately die
fighting these bastards.

113
00:05:34,29 --> 00:05:35,91
So what I'm asking is this.

114
00:05:36,79 --> 00:05:40,54
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real

115
00:05:40,62 --> 00:05:43,91
than carve off useless pieces
till there's nothing left?

116
00:05:46,58 --> 00:05:48,91
I didn't risk my ass
for the Starpath unit.

117
00:05:49,87 --> 00:05:51,04
I came for you.

118
00:05:54,29 --> 00:05:55,45


119
00:05:57,45 --> 00:05:58,70
What's the offer?

120
00:05:58,79 --> 00:05:59,95
Five days.

121
00:06:00,04 --> 00:06:01,62
Big stakes, big danger.

122
00:06:02,41 --> 00:06:03,91
Prepped team, good plan.

123
00:06:04,83 --> 00:06:07,58
You survive and deliver,
I'll give you 200,000.

124
00:06:09,83 --> 00:06:10,87


125
00:06:13,12 --> 00:06:14,75
What would we be stealing?

126
00:06:15,66 --> 00:06:19,04
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

127
00:06:19,12 --> 00:06:21,79


128
00:06:24,25 --> 00:06:25,29


129
00:06:41,16 --> 00:06:45,25


130
00:06:55,41 --> 00:06:57,70
GRANDI: With the next quarter's
detention estimates

131
00:06:57,79 --> 00:07:00,91
expected to increase
across the Ryloth sector,

132
00:07:01,00 --> 00:07:03,83
any further erosion in local authority

133
00:07:03,91 --> 00:07:06,29
may require an increase
in our blackline budget.

134
00:07:06,37 --> 00:07:09,66
PARTAGAZ: And where would you target
these new resources, Supervisor Grandi?

135
00:07:10,50 --> 00:07:12,25
Uh, increase surveillance, sir.

136
00:07:12,33 --> 00:07:13,37
PARTAGAZ: Looking for what?

137
00:07:14,58 --> 00:07:17,33
GRANDI: Anti-Imperial activity as always.


138
00:07:18,62 --> 00:07:21,25
PARTAGAZ: Uh, are you being
intentionally vague?

139
00:07:21,95 --> 00:07:22,95
GRANDI: No, sir.

140
00:07:23,04 --> 00:07:25,66
I'll expect specifics
by the end of the day. Lagret,

141
00:07:25,75 --> 00:07:28,20
-what is this item from Arvala-Six?


142
00:07:28,29 --> 00:07:29,83
A positive development, sir.

143
00:07:29,91 --> 00:07:32,54
The dimensions of the conflict
have diminished sufficiently

144
00:07:32,62 --> 00:07:34,87
that mining has resumed
on the occupied lands.

145
00:07:34,95 --> 00:07:36,62
PARTAGAZ: Storage issues
with the displaced?

146
00:07:36,70 --> 00:07:37,70
LAGRET: Ongoing.

147
00:07:37,79 --> 00:07:40,83
As is your unfinished memorandum
of recommendations regarding the problem.

148
00:07:40,91 --> 00:07:44,83
My staff is awaiting an assessment
from Arvala-Six's ministerial director.

149
00:07:44,91 --> 00:07:47,95
Because they've done
such an excellent job so far, hmm?

150
00:07:50,45 --> 00:07:52,70
 What do we do here?
-LAGRET: Sir?

151
00:07:52,79 --> 00:07:54,54
PARTAGAZ: What is our purpose, Lagret?

152
00:07:54,62 --> 00:07:55,70
LAGRET: On Arvala-Six?

153
00:07:55,79 --> 00:07:57,41
I open the question to the room.

154
00:07:57,50 --> 00:08:00,75
What do we do in this building?
Why are we here? Anyone?

155
00:08:00,83 --> 00:08:04,00
We're here to further security objectives
by collecting intelligence,

156
00:08:04,08 --> 00:08:08,29
providing useful analysis, and conducting
effective covert action, sir.

157
00:08:08,37 --> 00:08:09,62
Very good, Dedra.

158
00:08:09,70 --> 00:08:13,70
That is verbatim
from the ISB mission statement, and wrong.

159
00:08:16,00 --> 00:08:17,62
Security is an illusion.

160
00:08:17,70 --> 00:08:19,25
You want security? Call the Navy.

161
00:08:19,33 --> 00:08:20,91
Launch a regiment of troopers.

162
00:08:21,00 --> 00:08:22,75
We are healthcare providers.

163
00:08:22,83 --> 00:08:23,91
We treat sickness.

164
00:08:24,00 --> 00:08:25,58
We identify symptoms.

165
00:08:25,66 --> 00:08:30,54
We locate germs whether they arise
from within or have come from the outside.

166
00:08:30,62 --> 00:08:34,95
The longer we wait to identify a disorder,
the harder it is to treat the disease.

167
00:08:35,04 --> 00:08:36,91
-Do you understand my meaning, Lagret?
-Yes, sir.

168
00:08:37,00 --> 00:08:39,00
PARTAGAZ: Don't trouble yourself
writing the memorandum.

169
00:08:39,08 --> 00:08:40,12
I'll reassign it.

170
00:08:40,20 --> 00:08:43,45
Blevin, Morlana sector.
This incident on Ferrix.

171
00:08:43,54 --> 00:08:46,33
Corporate Security, sir.
They're still in charge out there.

172
00:08:46,41 --> 00:08:49,33
They tried to serve a warrant and ran into
more trouble than they'd anticipated.

173
00:08:49,41 --> 00:08:50,50
Trouble meaning what?

174
00:08:50,58 --> 00:08:52,29
Several dead. Property damage.

175
00:08:52,37 --> 00:08:53,79
Interruption of service.

176
00:08:53,87 --> 00:08:57,12
A stolen Imperial Starpath unit
was recovered at the scene.

177
00:08:57,20 --> 00:08:59,08
PARTAGAZ: Those responsible?
BLEVIN: Unknown, sir.

178
00:08:59,16 --> 00:09:02,91
-I'm heading out after this meeting.
-We'll speak before you leave.

179
00:09:03,00 --> 00:09:04,45
-Jung.
-JUNG: Sir?

180
00:09:04,54 --> 00:09:07,20
PARTAGAZ: Elaborate on these
added protection requests

181
00:09:07,29 --> 00:09:09,16
for traffic to the Abrion sector.

182
00:09:09,25 --> 00:09:10,87
JUNG: Proactive measure, sir.

183
00:09:10,95 --> 00:09:14,29
There's an increase in construction
shipments going to Scarif, sir.

184
00:09:15,00 --> 00:09:17,00


185
00:09:26,75 --> 00:09:28,70


186
00:09:29,91 --> 00:09:31,00
LUTHEN: Think of a name.

187
00:09:32,50 --> 00:09:35,08
-Think of a name for yourself.


188
00:09:36,66 --> 00:09:38,79
 Clem.

189
00:09:38,87 --> 00:09:40,83
For the next five days, you'll be Clem.

190
00:09:45,95 --> 00:09:47,45


191
00:09:48,91 --> 00:09:52,00


192
00:10:02,45 --> 00:10:03,54
Who's that?

193
00:10:03,62 --> 00:10:05,33
You'll be working for her.

194
00:10:06,00 --> 00:10:07,62
I thought you were in charge.

195
00:10:07,70 --> 00:10:08,79
LUTHEN: I never said that.

196
00:10:10,25 --> 00:10:12,50
She's gonna hate this idea to start.

197
00:10:12,58 --> 00:10:13,91
She's gonna argue with me.

198
00:10:16,16 --> 00:10:20,20
Think it's best you stay inside
until I've had time to work it all out.

199
00:10:28,16 --> 00:10:29,16
Take this.

200
00:10:32,25 --> 00:10:33,25
What is it?

201
00:10:33,33 --> 00:10:34,54
It's a down payment.

202
00:10:35,75 --> 00:10:36,87
It's a Kuati Signet.

203
00:10:36,95 --> 00:10:38,66
Blue kyber. Sky stone.

204
00:10:38,75 --> 00:10:40,04
The ancient world.

205
00:10:40,12 --> 00:10:43,54
Celebrates the uprising
against the Rakatan invaders.

206
00:10:45,37 --> 00:10:47,37
Don't take less than 50,000 for it.

207
00:10:48,04 --> 00:10:50,54
Just know
it will always be worth more to me.

208
00:10:51,33 --> 00:10:54,29
-I want it back when this is over.


209
00:10:55,33 --> 00:10:56,50
If I live.

210
00:10:56,58 --> 00:10:57,95
I want it back.

211
00:11:02,37 --> 00:11:04,91
-Against 200,000.
-LUTHEN: Giving you my word.

212
00:11:14,91 --> 00:11:18,37


213
00:11:19,70 --> 00:11:21,20


214
00:11:21,29 --> 00:11:24,75


215
00:11:29,37 --> 00:11:31,79
-Hello, Vel.
-VEL: We almost didn't get the message.

216
00:11:31,87 --> 00:11:32,91
LUTHEN: I'm glad you made it.

217
00:11:33,00 --> 00:11:35,04
They've started patrolling
the old Stone Valley.

218
00:11:35,12 --> 00:11:36,75
It's a full day gettin' out here now.

219
00:11:36,83 --> 00:11:39,00
I like hearing that. The vigilance.

220
00:11:39,08 --> 00:11:40,50
I count on your discipline.

221
00:11:41,29 --> 00:11:42,91
Obviously something's wrong.

222
00:11:43,00 --> 00:11:46,37
No. Actually,
I think things are coming together.

223
00:12:02,08 --> 00:12:05,50


224
00:12:05,58 --> 00:12:07,33
FONDOR DROID MOD:
<i>Something I can help you with?</i>

225
00:12:09,58 --> 00:12:10,58


226
00:12:10,66 --> 00:12:14,87
He can pilot. He can shoot. He can lie.
He speaks Alarin, Myo, Nari.

227
00:12:14,95 --> 00:12:17,00
He's got steady nerves
and isn't afraid to kill.

228
00:12:17,08 --> 00:12:19,62
-I can't believe you're doing this.
-He can pilot.

229
00:12:19,70 --> 00:12:21,16
We go in three days!

230
00:12:21,25 --> 00:12:23,83
He increases your chances
of success dramatically.

231
00:12:23,91 --> 00:12:25,45
Now? Like this?

232
00:12:25,54 --> 00:12:26,62
Five months in?

233
00:12:26,70 --> 00:12:29,08
Just plug in some new person?

234
00:12:29,16 --> 00:12:30,41
It'll tear the team apart.

235
00:12:30,50 --> 00:12:32,66
Well, then it's not much of a team, is it?

236
00:12:34,70 --> 00:12:38,16
You're vulnerable and you know it.
I'm buying you critical redundancy.

237
00:12:38,83 --> 00:12:40,70
What do you mean "buying"?

238
00:12:40,79 --> 00:12:42,12
I'm paying him.

239
00:12:42,20 --> 00:12:43,41
No.

240
00:12:43,50 --> 00:12:44,83
LUTHEN: Two hundred thousand.

241
00:12:46,04 --> 00:12:49,08
We've been eating roots
and sleeping on rocks for this rebellion

242
00:12:49,16 --> 00:12:51,45
 and now you've got
a mercenary on board?

243
00:12:54,25 --> 00:12:56,37
You're wasting energy. You know I'm right.

244
00:12:57,29 --> 00:12:58,62
We need this to work, Vel.

245
00:12:59,33 --> 00:13:01,04
Failure would be devastating.

246
00:13:01,12 --> 00:13:02,45
What would I tell the others?

247
00:13:02,54 --> 00:13:05,00
You'll tell them
it was always a part of the plan.

248
00:13:06,08 --> 00:13:07,79
Are you giving me a choice here?

249
00:13:07,87 --> 00:13:09,16
Yeah.

250
00:13:09,25 --> 00:13:10,87
You take him or call it off.

251
00:13:11,83 --> 00:13:13,45
I was planning to shut you down.

252
00:13:14,58 --> 00:13:17,41
Your odds have improved
since we set the meeting.

253
00:13:17,50 --> 00:13:20,50
You'll take him in
and lie about how it's come to pass.

254
00:13:20,58 --> 00:13:23,95
You'll plug him in as a replacement
for anyone who goes down along the way.

255
00:13:24,04 --> 00:13:26,87
In the next three days,
if for any reason... Look at me!

256
00:13:26,95 --> 00:13:28,08
You wanted to lead?

257
00:13:28,58 --> 00:13:30,12
This is what it comes to.

258
00:13:30,70 --> 00:13:31,70
You got three days.

259
00:13:31,79 --> 00:13:34,79
Something feels off,
something turns, someone starts to fold,

260
00:13:34,87 --> 00:13:37,83
you step up, you lead,
you cancel the mission.

261
00:13:37,91 --> 00:13:39,50
I need to know you understand.

262
00:13:40,33 --> 00:13:41,83
And if he's the problem?

263
00:13:41,91 --> 00:13:44,04
Well, that's the advantage of renting him.

264
00:13:44,70 --> 00:13:46,00
He's disposable.

265
00:13:50,37 --> 00:13:51,91
This has to be a win, Vel.

266
00:13:57,50 --> 00:13:58,50
Yes.

267
00:14:01,66 --> 00:14:02,66
Yes.

268
00:14:06,37 --> 00:14:07,37
Clem!

269
00:14:22,37 --> 00:14:23,87


270
00:14:23,95 --> 00:14:25,45
BLEVIN: You will immediately relinquish

271
00:14:25,54 --> 00:14:28,95
any and all comlinks,
weapons, and scandocs.

272
00:14:29,04 --> 00:14:31,33
You will not return
to your living quarters.

273
00:14:31,41 --> 00:14:35,16
You will leave here and be escorted
with haste to the transfer center,

274
00:14:35,25 --> 00:14:37,75
where you'll be issued
with any personal items

275
00:14:37,83 --> 00:14:40,95
that the Imperial inspectors
have had time to inventory.

276
00:14:41,04 --> 00:14:43,66
You will holo-certify
receipt of said items.

277
00:14:43,75 --> 00:14:48,87
You will holo-certify confirmation
of the official ISB After Action Report

278
00:14:48,95 --> 00:14:52,41
detailing your involvement
and culpability in said Ferrix incident.

279
00:14:52,50 --> 00:14:53,50
-Question, sir.
-BLEVIN: No.

280
00:14:55,04 --> 00:14:59,41
And no, you will not waste
further Imperial time reading the reports.

281
00:14:59,50 --> 00:15:01,45
But I've had nothing to do with this.

282
00:15:01,54 --> 00:15:02,70
Well, exactly.

283
00:15:06,95 --> 00:15:09,16
It took the combined ingredients

284
00:15:09,25 --> 00:15:13,08
of idiocy, ineptitude,
and total disengagement

285
00:15:13,16 --> 00:15:17,08
for this farce to have reached
the full apex of incredulous disaster.

286
00:15:18,75 --> 00:15:19,75
Seriously?

287
00:15:21,00 --> 00:15:24,83
My files are filled
with Corporate Security fiascos,

288
00:15:24,91 --> 00:15:26,62
but this takes the prize.

289
00:15:27,41 --> 00:15:30,62
And you, Deputy Inspector Karn.

290
00:15:31,29 --> 00:15:32,54
Proud, are we?

291
00:15:35,83 --> 00:15:36,91
Take solace in this.

292
00:15:37,00 --> 00:15:39,12
You will not be replaced.

293
00:15:39,20 --> 00:15:41,87
You've rung the final bell
on Corporate independence.

294
00:15:41,95 --> 00:15:47,70
As of this morning, the Morlana system
is under permanent Imperial authority.

295
00:15:49,50 --> 00:15:51,08
Congratulations on that.

296
00:16:07,25 --> 00:16:09,41
VEL: Is your arm
something I need to worry about?

297
00:16:09,50 --> 00:16:10,54
CASSIAN: No.

298
00:16:10,62 --> 00:16:13,29
VEL: Well, it's a long walk,
through the night.

299
00:16:13,37 --> 00:16:15,54


300
00:16:15,62 --> 00:16:16,62
Who is he?

301
00:16:17,37 --> 00:16:19,75
You should've asked him that
when you had the chance.

302
00:16:20,62 --> 00:16:24,33
He told me you were the boss
and you wouldn't like my being here.

303
00:16:25,62 --> 00:16:26,87
That's about all I know.

304
00:16:27,33 --> 00:16:29,75
He is something we will never discuss.

305
00:16:29,83 --> 00:16:31,45
When we get to camp,
we're going to tell them

306
00:16:31,54 --> 00:16:34,12
this was my idea
and we've been planning it all the while.

307
00:16:34,20 --> 00:16:35,70
We never mention him.

308
00:16:37,20 --> 00:16:41,12
If you change that in any way,
you and I are going to have a big problem.

309
00:16:41,20 --> 00:16:45,20


310
00:16:45,29 --> 00:16:46,87


311
00:16:46,95 --> 00:16:48,33
And why so far?

312
00:16:48,87 --> 00:16:51,70
We're robbing the armory
at the Aldhani Garrison.

313
00:16:51,79 --> 00:16:53,50
There's an Imperial airfield nearby,

314
00:16:53,58 --> 00:16:55,54
and they've got nothing better to do
than patrol.

315
00:16:55,62 --> 00:16:57,37
So, this is the safe route.

316
00:16:57,45 --> 00:16:59,87
He told me about the payroll,
not the garrison!

317
00:16:59,95 --> 00:17:01,87
I don't know who you're talking about.

318
00:17:02,45 --> 00:17:04,16
You're taking on an Imperial armory?

319
00:17:04,25 --> 00:17:05,45
Are you not joining us?

320
00:17:05,54 --> 00:17:07,37
Us? How many of us are there?

321
00:17:07,45 --> 00:17:08,83
Now we are seven.

322
00:17:08,91 --> 00:17:11,37
 Seven?
 Seven against a garrison?

323
00:17:11,45 --> 00:17:14,16
-Save your wind. This is a long walk.


324
00:17:14,25 --> 00:17:15,62
Hey, hold on. Hold on.

325
00:17:17,75 --> 00:17:19,08

-Get down! Tuck in!

326
00:17:19,20 --> 00:17:22,08


327
00:17:23,66 --> 00:17:28,75


328
00:17:30,58 --> 00:17:31,95
They won't be back today.

329
00:17:33,70 --> 00:17:34,70
Come on.

330
00:17:41,54 --> 00:17:43,16
-This says five dead.


331
00:17:43,25 --> 00:17:46,00
One local
and four Pre-Mor security employees.

332
00:17:46,70 --> 00:17:48,12
Uh, they've misspelt Ferrix.

333
00:17:48,20 --> 00:17:49,83
Where is my Starpath unit?

334
00:17:50,79 --> 00:17:52,04
Where are you?

335
00:17:53,04 --> 00:17:55,37
He said it in the meeting.
It's got to be here.

336
00:17:56,16 --> 00:17:58,75
HEERT: There's a raw transmission
in here somewhere.

337
00:17:59,70 --> 00:18:00,70
Hang on.

338
00:18:00,79 --> 00:18:05,37
"Varnisi. Unauthorized Imperial equipment,
Ferrix, 0430.

339
00:18:06,04 --> 00:18:11,16
"Ensign retrieved a sealed Imperial
NS-9 Starpath unit from the site."

340
00:18:12,00 --> 00:18:14,20
That is our box from Steergard.

341
00:18:14,29 --> 00:18:15,41
Has to be.

342
00:18:15,50 --> 00:18:17,04
Right, that gives us jurisdiction.

343
00:18:17,12 --> 00:18:18,45
I want you to go to Blevin's office,

344
00:18:18,54 --> 00:18:20,50
tell them we need
everything they've got on Ferrix.

345
00:18:20,58 --> 00:18:22,16
It might mean more if you went.

346
00:18:22,25 --> 00:18:24,08
I don't want to spark his interest.

347
00:18:30,70 --> 00:18:33,08

00:19:03,37 --> 00:19:04,58


356
00:19:41,62 --> 00:19:42,91
CASSIAN: What is this place?

357
00:19:43,79 --> 00:19:45,00
Nothing special.

358
00:19:45,66 --> 00:19:48,20
There used to be hundreds
of settlements up here.

359
00:19:48,29 --> 00:19:51,33
Forty thousand Aldhanis
all across the highlands.

360
00:19:52,50 --> 00:19:54,00
They were here for centuries,

361
00:19:54,87 --> 00:19:58,20
but it only took the Empire
a decade to clear them out.

362
00:19:58,29 --> 00:20:00,33
-Killed them?
-VEL: No.

363
00:20:01,08 --> 00:20:02,20
Drove them south.

364
00:20:02,95 --> 00:20:05,37
There's an Enterprise Zone
in the Lowlands.

365
00:20:06,95 --> 00:20:09,66
Factories, new towns, Imperial housing.

366
00:20:10,58 --> 00:20:13,58
Aldhani has the unfortunate quality
of being close to nothing

367
00:20:13,66 --> 00:20:15,62
and not very far away from everything.

368
00:20:16,70 --> 00:20:18,79
It's the perfect hub for distribution.

369
00:20:19,75 --> 00:20:22,04
If one were trying
to take over the galaxy.

370
00:20:23,29 --> 00:20:24,95
So, who are we supposed to be?

371
00:20:26,12 --> 00:20:28,08
There's still
a few shepherds in the hills.

372
00:20:28,70 --> 00:20:32,41
Nature lovers, mystics, dead-enders.

373
00:20:33,12 --> 00:20:35,16
Drink up. We've a way to go.

374
00:20:37,79 --> 00:20:38,91


375
00:20:47,29 --> 00:20:48,33

00:20:48,83 --> 00:20:50,79


377
00:20:50,87 --> 00:20:52,04
My assistant tells me

378
00:20:52,12 --> 00:20:55,29
you refused to turn over the file
on this incident in Ferrix.

379
00:20:55,37 --> 00:20:56,79
I have work to do.

380
00:20:56,87 --> 00:20:59,95
That was an official request
made by an officer of my staff.

381
00:21:00,04 --> 00:21:02,87
I suggest you schedule an appointment.

382
00:21:02,95 --> 00:21:04,83
I want the full Ferrix report.

383
00:21:04,91 --> 00:21:06,12
It's my sector.

384
00:21:06,20 --> 00:21:09,12
An Imperial Starpath unit was stolen
from the Steergard Naval Yard

385
00:21:09,20 --> 00:21:12,16
and found at the scene.
That gives me jurisdictional access.

386
00:21:13,16 --> 00:21:15,12
You've been here, what, just over a year?

387
00:21:15,66 --> 00:21:18,75
You might want to steady the ladder
before you start climbing.

388
00:21:18,83 --> 00:21:20,83
I'm not looking for career advice.

389
00:21:21,41 --> 00:21:23,83
You fall here, you fall alone.

390
00:21:23,91 --> 00:21:25,45
Are you denying my request?

391
00:21:26,04 --> 00:21:27,37
For the second time today.

392
00:21:27,45 --> 00:21:29,33
Fine. I'll take it to Major Partagaz.

393
00:21:30,25 --> 00:21:31,37
Don't look down.

394
00:21:33,29 --> 00:21:35,29


395
00:21:57,54 --> 00:22:00,12



396
00:22:00,20 --> 00:22:01,87

-MAN: Everyone's dead.

397
00:22:03,45 --> 00:22:06,70
While you were sleeping,
they came in, slit everybody's throat.

398
00:22:06,79 --> 00:22:08,41
You ride with Mossy, Garvish?

399
00:22:09,08 --> 00:22:10,58
Saw Gerrera?

400
00:22:10,66 --> 00:22:14,12
Fall asleep on watch, they're gonna put
your head on a pike for a laugh.

401
00:22:14,20 --> 00:22:15,50
Sorry.

402
00:22:15,58 --> 00:22:16,66
Don't tell Vel.

403
00:22:16,75 --> 00:22:17,79
I won't.

404
00:22:17,87 --> 00:22:19,08
You will.

405
00:22:19,66 --> 00:22:22,75
You better think what you're gonna say
'cause she's coming down now.

406
00:22:27,41 --> 00:22:28,50
Actually...

407
00:22:30,29 --> 00:22:31,50


408
00:22:31,58 --> 00:22:33,54

-MAN: ...there's two.

409
00:22:35,25 --> 00:22:36,62
What do you make of that?

410
00:22:46,00 --> 00:22:47,95
We better make sure
they know what's comin'.

411
00:22:48,91 --> 00:22:52,29


412
00:22:55,37 --> 00:22:56,70
Who is it?

413
00:22:56,79 --> 00:22:58,50
That's what I was gonna ask you.

414
00:23:00,41 --> 00:23:03,95


415
00:23:04,58 --> 00:23:06,16


416
00:23:07,79 --> 00:23:08,95
What's she doing?

417
00:23:34,91 --> 00:23:35,91
VEL: Gather up.

418
00:23:37,66 --> 00:23:38,66
This is Clem.

419
00:23:39,91 --> 00:23:41,33
Haven't mentioned him before now

420
00:23:41,41 --> 00:23:43,87
because I wasn't sure
we could get him here on time.

421
00:23:43,95 --> 00:23:45,16
We've had a stroke of luck.

422
00:23:45,25 --> 00:23:47,66
He's been able to fight his way free.

423
00:23:47,75 --> 00:23:50,33
He'll give us critical redundancy
in all areas.

424
00:23:50,41 --> 00:23:52,37
It's a bit late for surprises.

425
00:23:54,33 --> 00:23:55,37
That's Skeen.

426
00:23:56,08 --> 00:23:57,33
This is Taramyn.

427
00:23:59,20 --> 00:24:00,25
Nemik.

428
00:24:03,75 --> 00:24:04,79
And Cinta.

429
00:24:06,29 --> 00:24:08,25
We've always known we were short a man.

430
00:24:08,33 --> 00:24:09,58
Can I speak with you?

431
00:24:09,66 --> 00:24:11,25
Let's get Clem settled in.

432
00:24:12,12 --> 00:24:13,58
NEMIK: Good to have you, Clem.

433
00:24:13,66 --> 00:24:15,50
We'll take all the help we can get.

434
00:24:16,87 --> 00:24:19,70
Cinta, feed him
and then take a look at his arm.

435
00:24:19,79 --> 00:24:22,37
-Vel.
-The posts on the corral are down again.

436
00:24:22,45 --> 00:24:24,95
Now, unless you two want to be
chasin' animals all day,

437
00:24:25,04 --> 00:24:27,16
I'd get out there now. Okay?

438
00:24:27,25 --> 00:24:28,25
Let's get to it.

439
00:24:28,91 --> 00:24:31,20
We'll work Clem into the program at drill.

440
00:24:40,54 --> 00:24:42,00


441
00:24:42,08 --> 00:24:45,45
ANNOUNCER: 
<i>Telgordo Travel service to Hosnian Prime,</i>

442
00:24:45,54 --> 00:24:48,29
<i>Plexis, and Eufornis Major</i>

443
00:24:48,37 --> 00:24:53,87
<i>will now be departing</i>
<i>from platforms 7-12 and 7-13.</i>

444
00:24:56,70 --> 00:24:59,79
<i>Do not join the line</i>
<i>without your boarding pass.</i>

445
00:25:02,16 --> 00:25:07,00


446
00:25:19,91 --> 00:25:21,58


447
00:25:22,29 --> 00:25:23,29


448
00:25:23,37 --> 00:25:25,20


449
00:25:27,87 --> 00:25:29,62


450
00:25:42,50 --> 00:25:44,54


451
00:26:02,00 --> 00:26:03,16


452
00:26:14,20 --> 00:26:15,25


453
00:26:16,37 --> 00:26:17,37
Mother.

454
00:26:22,62 --> 00:26:25,70


455
00:26:29,08 --> 00:26:30,41


456
00:26:30,50 --> 00:26:32,29
What are you starin' at?

457
00:26:32,37 --> 00:26:34,20


458
00:26:36,45 --> 00:26:38,75


459
00:26:44,83 --> 00:26:46,08
Blaster burn.

460
00:26:46,16 --> 00:26:47,54
Needs to be cleaned.

461
00:26:56,00 --> 00:26:57,33
Apologies in advance.

462
00:26:58,25 --> 00:27:00,16
We're trying to save our pain meds.

463
00:27:06,91 --> 00:27:09,45
-How do you know him?
-He comes highly recommended.

464
00:27:09,54 --> 00:27:11,58
-So you don't know him.
-VEL: I know that we need him.

465
00:27:11,66 --> 00:27:14,33
That's all I'll say.
Anything else is a violation of security.

466
00:27:14,41 --> 00:27:16,75
No, he's got brass.
You... You can feel it.

467
00:27:16,83 --> 00:27:19,54
And we can use a hand,
but this late in the game?

468
00:27:19,62 --> 00:27:21,87
-As opposed to when?
-You trust him with our lives?

469
00:27:21,95 --> 00:27:23,12
That's my call to make.

470
00:27:24,41 --> 00:27:25,83
NEMIK: He's committed.

471
00:27:25,91 --> 00:27:27,04
I'm feeling that.

472
00:27:27,87 --> 00:27:28,91
I want to.

473
00:27:29,00 --> 00:27:30,12
Feel what?

474
00:27:30,20 --> 00:27:31,54
His belief in the cause.

475
00:27:32,66 --> 00:27:35,04
When it comes down to it,
that's all I need to know.

476
00:27:37,50 --> 00:27:38,50
Vel.

477
00:27:39,70 --> 00:27:41,20
-Vel!
-I trust him.

478
00:27:43,16 --> 00:27:44,37
Okay?

479
00:27:44,95 --> 00:27:46,20
All right?

480
00:27:51,75 --> 00:27:55,41


481
00:28:02,54 --> 00:28:04,16
KLEYA: Senator Mon Mothma's here.

482
00:28:06,66 --> 00:28:07,66
New driver.

483
00:28:08,87 --> 00:28:10,00
LUTHEN: Anyone we know?

484
00:28:10,62 --> 00:28:11,75
Never seen him.

485
00:28:13,12 --> 00:28:14,12
Chandrilan?

486
00:28:15,04 --> 00:28:16,95
 One would think.

487
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:20,54


488
00:28:20,62 --> 00:28:21,62
Senator.

489
00:28:22,20 --> 00:28:24,50
-What a pleasure to see you.
-You as well, Luthen.

490
00:28:24,58 --> 00:28:27,12
Sorry to be so late.
It's always right when you're leaving,

491
00:28:27,20 --> 00:28:30,12
everyone remembers things
they're meant to bother you with.

492
00:28:30,20 --> 00:28:33,50
 Free your mind, Senator.
This is a place where time stands still.

493
00:28:33,58 --> 00:28:35,75
It's hard being surrounded
with this much history

494
00:28:35,83 --> 00:28:39,08
and not be humbled by the insignificance
of our daily anxieties.

495
00:28:39,16 --> 00:28:41,66
How true. 
And how I need to hear that.

496
00:28:41,75 --> 00:28:43,41
-You know Kleya.
-Of course.

497
00:28:43,50 --> 00:28:44,95
We often refer to the gallery

498
00:28:45,04 --> 00:28:47,25
as Coruscant's unofficial
temple of patience. 

499
00:28:47,33 --> 00:28:49,54
Well, I have to start
coming here more often.

500
00:28:49,62 --> 00:28:50,95

-You're teasing us.

501
00:28:51,70 --> 00:28:53,33
So, a gift for your husband.

502
00:28:53,41 --> 00:28:56,58
Yes. It's his Day of Days.
It's a Chandrilan custom.

503
00:28:56,66 --> 00:28:57,66
One of our many.

504
00:28:57,75 --> 00:28:58,95
Yours is a rich history.

505
00:28:59,04 --> 00:29:01,00
Well, that's a kind way of putting it.

506
00:29:01,08 --> 00:29:02,70
I put aside a few things.

507
00:29:02,79 --> 00:29:06,37
If I recall,
he has an interest in military artifacts.

508
00:29:06,45 --> 00:29:07,45
Yes.

509
00:29:07,54 --> 00:29:09,16
LUTHEN: So,
let's start with the oldest one.

510
00:29:09,25 --> 00:29:11,54
It's a Utapaun monk cudgel.

511
00:29:11,62 --> 00:29:14,04
You see the ceremonial variety
in many places,

512
00:29:14,12 --> 00:29:15,37
but this is the real thing.

513
00:29:15,45 --> 00:29:17,25
It's a unique gift for most, but...

514
00:29:18,62 --> 00:29:20,95
it's a treasure for the true aficionado.

515
00:29:21,75 --> 00:29:23,37
Dated to the eighth archaic settlem...

516
00:29:23,45 --> 00:29:24,70
May I show you something?

517
00:29:25,66 --> 00:29:28,33
Oh, don't bother.
I couldn't afford anything here.

518
00:29:28,41 --> 00:29:30,75
Please. There's no harm in looking.

519
00:29:30,83 --> 00:29:33,16
We just got in
some terribly interesting coins.

520
00:29:34,58 --> 00:29:35,95
-Yeah.


521
00:29:37,29 --> 00:29:41,33
I'm trying to expand Perrin's tastes
beyond fighting implements.

522
00:29:41,41 --> 00:29:43,37
Is there anything else
that might interest him?

523
00:29:43,45 --> 00:29:44,62
Well, your timing is excellent.

524
00:29:44,70 --> 00:29:47,25
I have something very special
that just came in.

525
00:29:47,33 --> 00:29:48,33
Come with me.

526
00:29:52,00 --> 00:29:53,45
It's a two-faced divinity.

527
00:29:53,54 --> 00:29:55,45
Fourteen thousand years old.

528
00:29:55,54 --> 00:29:58,58
A sun goddess and a serpent
from the overworld

529
00:29:58,66 --> 00:30:01,12
sharing the same mouth. 

530
00:30:01,20 --> 00:30:03,41
 If you can't deliver,
I need to know.

531
00:30:03,50 --> 00:30:05,83
-Do you think I'm not trying?
-I never think that.

532
00:30:05,91 --> 00:30:08,41
But I need to start planning
if you're no longer coming through.

533
00:30:08,50 --> 00:30:09,54
The money's there.

534
00:30:09,62 --> 00:30:11,91
It's just getting very dangerous
to move it around.

535
00:30:12,00 --> 00:30:14,62
I can't pull funds the way I used to.

536
00:30:14,70 --> 00:30:16,95
-They're watching me now.
-Oh, they're watching everyone.

537
00:30:17,04 --> 00:30:18,95
This is different. They're everywhere.

538
00:30:19,04 --> 00:30:21,50
There's a new spy every day at the Senate.

539
00:30:21,58 --> 00:30:24,79
I visit the bank, they're all new faces.

540
00:30:24,87 --> 00:30:26,16
You got a new driver.

541
00:30:26,25 --> 00:30:27,66


542
00:30:27,75 --> 00:30:29,12
I feel under siege.

543
00:30:31,83 --> 00:30:33,29
I have many mouths to feed.

544
00:30:33,37 --> 00:30:35,04
I can only forage for so long.

545
00:30:37,08 --> 00:30:39,62
I found someone I think can help me.

546
00:30:40,41 --> 00:30:41,70
Someone who?

547
00:30:41,79 --> 00:30:43,91
To bring into the circle? No.

548
00:30:44,00 --> 00:30:45,62
-I know what I'm asking.
-LUTHEN: No.

549
00:30:45,70 --> 00:30:46,79
We're vulnerable enough.

550
00:30:46,87 --> 00:30:48,62
We need funding, not more people.

551
00:30:48,70 --> 00:30:50,87
Don't lecture me on vulnerability.

552
00:30:50,95 --> 00:30:52,50
No one's more at risk than I am.

553
00:30:52,58 --> 00:30:54,70
You think I haven't thought this through?

554
00:30:54,79 --> 00:30:56,70
I'd be the first one to fall.

555
00:30:58,41 --> 00:30:59,91


556
00:31:05,66 --> 00:31:07,41
Why don't you take this on loan?

557
00:31:08,16 --> 00:31:09,29
May I?

558
00:31:09,37 --> 00:31:12,29
If your husband doesn't love it,
I'll be glad to take it back.

559
00:31:13,79 --> 00:31:15,25
It's a daring choice,

560
00:31:16,29 --> 00:31:18,66
but I trust you'll have the courage
to turn back

561
00:31:18,75 --> 00:31:20,33
if it should be a bit much.

562
00:31:21,25 --> 00:31:22,41
I appreciate that.

563
00:31:23,25 --> 00:31:24,33
You'll be here?

564
00:31:24,41 --> 00:31:26,66
Well, if not, Kleya can always reach me.

565
00:31:26,75 --> 00:31:29,12
Kleya, can we have this wrapped
for the Senator?

566
00:31:36,58 --> 00:31:39,58


567
00:31:44,95 --> 00:31:46,87



568
00:31:48,79 --> 00:31:50,83


569
00:31:50,91 --> 00:31:53,95


570
00:32:05,83 --> 00:32:08,45



571
00:32:16,37 --> 00:32:19,79


572
00:32:19,87 --> 00:32:21,33


573
00:32:25,41 --> 00:32:26,87


574
00:32:28,37 --> 00:32:29,75
He's with us.

575
00:32:29,83 --> 00:32:31,00
Stay.

576
00:32:31,58 --> 00:32:32,62
MAN: No, I didn't.

577
00:32:32,70 --> 00:32:34,08
 What the hell is going on?

578
00:32:34,95 --> 00:32:36,29
When did this happen?

579
00:32:37,08 --> 00:32:39,04
What, he's here now? Where?

580
00:32:39,12 --> 00:32:41,45
-Getting cleaned up.
-And we've no say in this?

581
00:32:41,54 --> 00:32:43,20
-It's not a vote.
-Just like that?

582
00:32:43,29 --> 00:32:44,54
It's been in the works.

583
00:32:44,62 --> 00:32:46,83
-What else don't I know about?
-This helps us.

584
00:32:46,91 --> 00:32:48,75
You were cutting it close.
You said it yourself.

585
00:32:48,83 --> 00:32:49,87
Three days out.

586
00:32:49,95 --> 00:32:52,16
What were you gonna do
if I couldn't get here today?

587
00:32:52,25 --> 00:32:53,87
Turn up with an extra face to explain?

588
00:32:53,95 --> 00:32:55,29
I knew you'd come through.

589
00:32:55,79 --> 00:32:57,20
We're not prepped for this.

590
00:32:57,29 --> 00:32:59,20
We don't even have enough comms as it is.

591
00:32:59,29 --> 00:33:01,25
-We have two spares.
-That was our backup.

592
00:33:01,33 --> 00:33:02,91
Clem is our backup.

593
00:33:03,83 --> 00:33:05,20
TARAMYN: We have an extra uniform.

594
00:33:05,29 --> 00:33:07,12
Gonna need to leave us
your belt and gloves.

595
00:33:07,95 --> 00:33:09,20
Clem.

596
00:33:11,16 --> 00:33:13,66
We need another hand, and you know it.

597
00:33:13,75 --> 00:33:15,58
I should've been consulted.

598
00:33:16,50 --> 00:33:17,58
On that, we agree.

599
00:33:18,62 --> 00:33:21,29
Clem, this is Lieutenant Gorn.

600
00:33:22,20 --> 00:33:25,58
-He's our contact at the garrison.
-Wounded on top of it.

601
00:33:25,66 --> 00:33:26,79
On top of what?

602
00:33:26,87 --> 00:33:30,16
Being someone I've never met
who's suddenly got my neck in their hands.

603
00:33:30,25 --> 00:33:31,29
I know the feeling.

604
00:33:31,37 --> 00:33:32,62
-Are we done?
-Who is he?

605
00:33:32,70 --> 00:33:34,66
He's Clem.
He's here, that's all that matters.

606
00:33:34,75 --> 00:33:37,16
Look, we're wasting daylight.
Let's get on with it.

607
00:33:37,25 --> 00:33:38,54
Give Nemik a hand.

608
00:33:44,04 --> 00:33:46,20
What's with all the patrols
on Stone Canyon?

609
00:33:46,79 --> 00:33:49,45
There's an Imperial engineer
arriving from Coruscant.

610
00:33:49,54 --> 00:33:52,29
We're mapping the old trail for him.
But that'll stop tomorrow.

611
00:33:52,37 --> 00:33:54,50
I'm pushing all our attention
toward the Lowlands.

612
00:33:54,58 --> 00:33:56,20
How long do we have you?

613
00:33:56,29 --> 00:33:57,83
I've got a midnight inspection.

614
00:33:57,91 --> 00:33:58,91
Let's get going.

615
00:34:01,20 --> 00:34:05,41


616
00:34:31,70 --> 00:34:32,75
What's all this?

617
00:34:34,12 --> 00:34:36,29
-Dinner for the governor.
-What governor?

618
00:34:36,37 --> 00:34:37,58
The governor of Hanna.

619
00:34:38,41 --> 00:34:39,91
My regimental mate, that governor.

620
00:34:40,00 --> 00:34:41,33
That's tonight?

621
00:34:42,25 --> 00:34:43,70
It's on your calendar.

622
00:34:43,79 --> 00:34:46,12
I added it a month ago
after we discussed it.

623
00:34:47,08 --> 00:34:48,33
-You don't remember?


624
00:34:48,41 --> 00:34:50,12
I remember you wearing me down.

625
00:34:51,45 --> 00:34:53,12
I didn't think anyone could do that.

626
00:34:53,70 --> 00:34:54,83
Are you enjoying this?

627
00:34:54,91 --> 00:34:57,16
No. Just looking forward
to seeing some old friends.

628
00:34:57,25 --> 00:34:58,50
Oh, who else is coming?

629
00:34:58,58 --> 00:35:00,00
Seating chart's just there.

630
00:35:03,45 --> 00:35:07,16
Ars Dangor? Sly Moore?
From the Vizier's private chamber?

631
00:35:07,25 --> 00:35:08,41
Is that a problem?

632
00:35:08,50 --> 00:35:10,00
You can't be serious.
These people hate me.

633
00:35:10,08 --> 00:35:12,37
They spend every day
trying to undo anything I've touched.

634
00:35:12,45 --> 00:35:14,62
Well, perhaps tomorrow
they'll think twice.

635
00:35:15,45 --> 00:35:16,70
Uh, not right now, please.

636
00:35:16,79 --> 00:35:17,83
Go!

637
00:35:21,12 --> 00:35:24,20
You shouldn't have invited them
without making sure I was aware.

638
00:35:24,29 --> 00:35:26,12
Well, it's a bit late to cancel.

639
00:35:27,29 --> 00:35:29,62
But at your pleasure.

640
00:35:30,37 --> 00:35:32,41


641
00:35:32,50 --> 00:35:33,66
Well played, Perrin.

642
00:35:34,45 --> 00:35:36,45
And no, I'm not being serious.

643
00:35:36,91 --> 00:35:38,29
Don't seat them near me.

644
00:35:38,37 --> 00:35:39,41
Oh, I've taken care of that.

645
00:35:39,50 --> 00:35:42,00
You're at the boring end of the table.
These people are fun.

646
00:35:42,08 --> 00:35:43,66
Oh, are they? Are they fun?

647
00:35:43,75 --> 00:35:45,79
We should find
some Ghorman guests for tonight

648
00:35:45,87 --> 00:35:47,33
and see how amused they are.

649
00:35:47,41 --> 00:35:50,50
Your fun friends just cut off
their shipping lanes yesterday.

650
00:35:50,58 --> 00:35:52,33
Do you know how many will starve?

651
00:35:52,41 --> 00:35:55,70
Oh, perhaps we can laugh about it
over the third course.

652
00:35:55,79 --> 00:35:57,20
Perhaps you should have a rest.

653
00:35:57,29 --> 00:35:59,04
If you make me pay attention, I will.

654
00:35:59,12 --> 00:36:00,29
And you won't be happy.

655
00:36:01,54 --> 00:36:03,08
Don't do this again.

656
00:36:05,54 --> 00:36:07,45
PERRIN: There's rumor
you bought me a present.

657
00:36:07,54 --> 00:36:08,87
It's going back.

658
00:36:09,41 --> 00:36:12,12
Must everything be boring and sad?

659
00:36:13,58 --> 00:36:14,62


660
00:36:15,91 --> 00:36:17,75
VEL: Akti Amaugh, the Valley of Caves.

661
00:36:17,83 --> 00:36:18,91
The sacred valley.

662
00:36:19,00 --> 00:36:20,83
The Empire came in 13 years ago

663
00:36:20,91 --> 00:36:24,58
and liberated the air base, Alkenzi,
50 klicks west of here.

664
00:36:24,66 --> 00:36:28,37
They quickly discovered the unique
storage possibilities of the caverns,

665
00:36:28,45 --> 00:36:30,20
claimed the land for the Emperor,

666
00:36:30,29 --> 00:36:33,45
and dammed up Nasma Klain,
the sacred river.

667
00:36:34,12 --> 00:36:38,16
Now, the Aldhani Garrison
is a depot for supplies, weapons,

668
00:36:38,25 --> 00:36:40,91
and the payroll
for the entire Imperial sector.

669
00:36:41,79 --> 00:36:44,91
Garrison, observation tower,
sentry defenses,

670
00:36:45,00 --> 00:36:47,04
all to protect this runway opening here.

671
00:36:47,12 --> 00:36:49,79
I'll do it. It's fragile, that piece.
The rain gets into the glue.

672
00:36:49,87 --> 00:36:52,08
VEL: The runway descends
underground to the flight deck

673
00:36:52,16 --> 00:36:54,58
of a single Max-7 Rono freighter.

674
00:36:54,66 --> 00:36:56,16
Vel said you could pilot.

675
00:36:56,25 --> 00:36:57,29
Fly a Rono?

676
00:36:57,83 --> 00:36:59,00
A box freighter?

677
00:36:59,08 --> 00:37:01,58
Mmm, it's not really flying, but yeah.

678
00:37:01,66 --> 00:37:04,45
VEL: This room behind the flight deck,
that's a vault.

679
00:37:05,29 --> 00:37:07,41
We're taking crates of payroll
from that room,

680
00:37:07,50 --> 00:37:10,41
loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.

681
00:37:10,50 --> 00:37:12,79
-Obviously, it's not to scale.
-Escaping?

682
00:37:12,87 --> 00:37:14,41
-In a Rono?
-Yeah.

683
00:37:14,50 --> 00:37:17,00
 Those were TIE fighters
we saw on the way in.

684
00:37:17,66 --> 00:37:19,66
-How far is the air base?
-From the garrison...

685
00:37:19,75 --> 00:37:21,54
-Fifty klicks, you said.
-Fifty-two.

686
00:37:21,62 --> 00:37:22,70
Fine, 52.

687
00:37:23,33 --> 00:37:24,58
They'll be on you in minutes.

688
00:37:24,66 --> 00:37:26,91
-Nine minutes. We've timed it.


689
00:37:27,00 --> 00:37:28,50
-VEL: Mmm.
-CASSIAN: Okay.

690
00:37:28,58 --> 00:37:30,62
You'll be lucky to make the horizon.

691
00:37:31,12 --> 00:37:32,16
It's a suicide run.

692
00:37:33,37 --> 00:37:34,37
Exactly.

693
00:37:34,45 --> 00:37:37,33
That's why they only keep
a 40-man regiment in the garrison.

694
00:37:37,41 --> 00:37:39,75
Because they know
no one's stupid enough to try it.

695
00:37:39,83 --> 00:37:41,00
No one but us.

696
00:37:43,83 --> 00:37:46,87

-These old stones, Nasma Brani,

697
00:37:46,95 --> 00:37:51,04
it's a temple or what's left of it
that once sat on the mighty river.

698
00:37:52,45 --> 00:37:53,91
Lieutenant Gorn, you tell it.

699
00:37:54,91 --> 00:37:56,41
Once every three years

700
00:37:56,50 --> 00:37:58,37
for as long as anyone can remember,

701
00:37:59,25 --> 00:38:01,91
the Aldhanis gather in this valley
for a celestial event

702
00:38:02,00 --> 00:38:04,12
they call <i>Mak-ani bray Dhani.</i>

703
00:38:04,87 --> 00:38:07,25
The Eye of Aldhani. Thousands of them.

704
00:38:08,20 --> 00:38:11,37
They'd hike for weeks to get here
just to see it from the sacred land.

705
00:38:11,45 --> 00:38:15,12
-To see what?
-Imagine 50 meteor showers all at once,

706
00:38:15,20 --> 00:38:18,16
but like a curtain
being pulled across the sky

707
00:38:18,25 --> 00:38:22,83
until the Eye, the window to the galaxy,
forms over the horizon.

708
00:38:22,91 --> 00:38:24,16
You've seen this?

709
00:38:24,25 --> 00:38:27,20
I've been here almost seven years.
I've seen it twice.

710
00:38:28,29 --> 00:38:30,50
It's not the event it used to be.

711
00:38:30,58 --> 00:38:33,50
Now they've got everyone relocated,
it's a pretty sad affair,

712
00:38:34,29 --> 00:38:35,54
but the Eye,

713
00:38:36,66 --> 00:38:38,58
it's not something you'll soon forget.

714
00:38:38,66 --> 00:38:40,12
Once every three years.

715
00:38:40,20 --> 00:38:43,37
To a thousandth of a second.
And it's not really a meteor shower.

716
00:38:43,45 --> 00:38:46,66
It's a recurrent band of crystalized,
noctilucent microdensities.

717
00:38:46,75 --> 00:38:49,75
Billions of crystals.
Very heavy but small and unstable.

718
00:38:49,83 --> 00:38:51,45
As the planet passes through the belt,

719
00:38:51,54 --> 00:38:53,83
they swarm the atmosphere,
heat up, and explode.

720
00:38:54,79 --> 00:38:57,29
From the ground, it's a thing of beauty.

721
00:38:57,37 --> 00:38:58,54
In the sky, it's chaos.

722
00:38:59,54 --> 00:39:01,29
We've calculated an escape trajectory

723
00:39:01,37 --> 00:39:03,66
that gets us out
just before the Eye closes.

724
00:39:05,08 --> 00:39:06,91
This happens in three days' time.

725
00:39:10,54 --> 00:39:11,91


726
00:39:12,00 --> 00:39:13,25
That's your cover.

727
00:39:13,95 --> 00:39:14,95
Yes.

728
00:39:15,04 --> 00:39:16,54
Gets us in, gets us out.

729
00:39:16,62 --> 00:39:19,33
They won't know where we came from,
and if we can beat the clock,

730
00:39:19,41 --> 00:39:21,70
we'll be gone
before they even know what happened.

731
00:39:21,79 --> 00:39:24,45
Now, you've got a lot to learn
and very little time to do it,

732
00:39:24,54 --> 00:39:28,62
so what we need to know is,
are you in all the way?

733
00:39:33,12 --> 00:39:34,20
Let's get to it.

734
00:39:37,37 --> 00:39:39,08

-Speak.

735
00:39:39,16 --> 00:39:41,83
She's demanding the raw data
from the incident on Ferrix.

736
00:39:41,91 --> 00:39:43,83
The Starpath unit
that was recovered at the scene

737
00:39:43,91 --> 00:39:46,79
has been traced to a theft
at an air base under my jurisdiction, sir.

738
00:39:46,87 --> 00:39:50,04
She's overreaching
to increase the size of her portfolio.

739
00:39:50,12 --> 00:39:52,58
She should spend more time
on the security at her bases

740
00:39:52,66 --> 00:39:55,41
-and less furthering her career.
-Lieutenant Meero.

741
00:39:55,50 --> 00:39:58,54
The stolen item has great value,
sir, particularly to the rebels.

742
00:39:58,62 --> 00:40:01,16
Tracing its theft
might expose activity in my sector.

743
00:40:01,25 --> 00:40:03,25
People also take things for money,
do they not?

744
00:40:03,33 --> 00:40:05,87
Is it worth creating
this much intra-office friction

745
00:40:05,95 --> 00:40:09,12
in the pursuit of what seems like
a case of a robbery gone awry?

746
00:40:09,20 --> 00:40:12,29
Sir, it is my feeling
that this is part of an ongoing effort

747
00:40:12,37 --> 00:40:16,04
to steal proprietary Imperial equipment
in anticipation of an organized rebellion.

748
00:40:16,12 --> 00:40:18,29
I have three
previous case files on my desk

749
00:40:18,37 --> 00:40:19,79
that begin to suggest a pattern.

750
00:40:19,87 --> 00:40:21,12
Your feeling.

751
00:40:21,20 --> 00:40:25,12
I'm seeing signs of coordinated activity
over a number of sectors.

752
00:40:25,20 --> 00:40:26,50
What activity?

753
00:40:26,58 --> 00:40:28,75
Similar items of interest,
repeated methods.

754
00:40:29,54 --> 00:40:31,75
-Gut instinct.
-You came to us from enforcement.

755
00:40:31,83 --> 00:40:32,83
Yes, sir.

756
00:40:32,91 --> 00:40:36,54
Here, we act on vetted
and verified information.

757
00:40:37,66 --> 00:40:41,08
Alert me when this materializes
into something more definite.

758
00:40:41,16 --> 00:40:43,87
Until then,
confine future activities to your sectors.

759
00:40:43,95 --> 00:40:45,12
Thank you, Lieutenant.

760
00:40:50,29 --> 00:40:55,08
You have two sectors to supervise.
Blevin is handling six.

761
00:40:55,79 --> 00:40:56,95
He does, I will admit,

762
00:40:57,04 --> 00:41:00,33
hew to the traditional viewpoint
of this office and its staffing.

763
00:41:00,41 --> 00:41:03,16
He is, I'm sure, a challenge to work with.

764
00:41:03,25 --> 00:41:06,41
His quarterly reports, however, are in
and yours are not,

765
00:41:06,50 --> 00:41:09,45
and here we are spending
your valuable time with this issue.

766
00:41:11,08 --> 00:41:13,70
There's a high bar
for your performance, Lieutenant.

767
00:41:14,66 --> 00:41:16,08
Unfair perhaps,

768
00:41:16,79 --> 00:41:18,25
but senseless to ignore

769
00:41:18,33 --> 00:41:21,54
and potentially the foundation
of a uniquely superior career.

770
00:41:23,25 --> 00:41:25,58
You're supposed to be
more competent and tucked away.

771
00:41:25,66 --> 00:41:26,83
That's why you're here.

772
00:41:28,25 --> 00:41:31,29
That's why we're bringing in
officers like you.

773
00:41:32,95 --> 00:41:35,62
Let's remind everyone of that
and not get lost in the dust.

774
00:41:35,70 --> 00:41:37,00
Yes, sir.

775
00:41:37,08 --> 00:41:40,83
On a positive note, I was impressed
with your detention numbers from Sev Tok.

776
00:41:40,91 --> 00:41:42,20
Far above the quota.

777
00:41:43,29 --> 00:41:45,25
I may be sending more
of that sort of work your way.

778
00:41:45,33 --> 00:41:46,79
-Thank you, sir.
-We're done.

779
00:41:50,62 --> 00:41:54,95


780
00:41:55,58 --> 00:41:59,16


781
00:42:14,66 --> 00:42:16,41
 Know how to use this?

782
00:42:17,04 --> 00:42:19,12


783
00:42:19,20 --> 00:42:20,20
Yeah.

784
00:42:20,29 --> 00:42:22,95
TARAMYN: That's the Rono freighter specs
and the console layout.

785
00:42:23,75 --> 00:42:25,04
You get done with that,

786
00:42:25,12 --> 00:42:27,08
that's a detailed map of the garrison.

787
00:42:29,45 --> 00:42:31,00
That's an Aldhani phrase book.

788
00:42:36,33 --> 00:42:37,54


789
00:42:42,37 --> 00:42:43,45
Can I eat my food?

790
00:42:45,29 --> 00:42:48,37
You'll eat,
you'll let Cinta check the bandage,

791
00:42:48,87 --> 00:42:51,12
and you'll have learned all that
by morning.

792
00:42:52,08 --> 00:42:53,41
I'll take the first watch.

793
00:42:55,00 --> 00:42:57,62
