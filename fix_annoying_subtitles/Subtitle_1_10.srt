1
00:00:01,79 --> 00:00:03,16
Something's wrong on Two.

2
00:00:03,16 --> 00:00:04,62
Something's really wrong on Two.

3
00:00:05,33 --> 00:00:06,33
Look at me.

4
00:00:06,33 --> 00:00:09,04
It takes a week for one word
to get all the way up here.

5
00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:10,54
You're panicking about something

6
00:00:10,54 --> 00:00:12,79
that's happening
on the other side of the building!

7
00:00:14,54 --> 00:00:15,79
You think they're listening?

8
00:00:15,79 --> 00:00:17,08
Like you would know.

9
00:00:17,08 --> 00:00:18,58
I know this.

10
00:00:18,58 --> 00:00:19,79
They don't need to care.

11
00:00:19,79 --> 00:00:22,62
All they need to do
is turn this floor on twice a day

12
00:00:22,62 --> 00:00:24,75
and keep their numbers rolling.

13
00:00:24,75 --> 00:00:25,87
<i>I need a loan.</i>

14
00:00:25,87 --> 00:00:27,79
You have someone in mind.

15
00:00:27,79 --> 00:00:29,00
It's not a long list.

16
00:00:29,00 --> 00:00:30,75
And yet you're afraid to say who it is.

17
00:00:31,58 --> 00:00:32,66
Davo Sculdun.

18
00:00:32,66 --> 00:00:33,95
He is not a banker.

19
00:00:34,70 --> 00:00:35,70
He's a thug.

20
00:00:37,08 --> 00:00:38,58
Your breathing sounds weak.

21
00:00:38,58 --> 00:00:41,33
The doctor was here yesterday.

22
00:00:42,29 --> 00:00:43,75
You really don't know where he is?

23
00:00:44,83 --> 00:00:46,29
New man on the floor!

24
00:00:47,87 --> 00:00:48,87
Hold your positions!

25
00:00:48,87 --> 00:00:50,50
I have a new idea.

26
00:00:54,29 --> 00:00:55,37
<i>Anto Kreegyr.</i>

27
00:00:55,37 --> 00:00:57,20
- I want you to meet him.
- Anto Kreegyr?

28
00:00:57,20 --> 00:01:00,29
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.

29
00:01:00,29 --> 00:01:03,37
We've got a rebel pilot in custody.
One of Anto Kreegyr's group.

30
00:01:03,37 --> 00:01:05,66
We don't think Kreegyr knows
he's gone missing yet.

31
00:01:05,66 --> 00:01:07,00
What if we foul the ship?

32
00:01:07,00 --> 00:01:08,95
Have the pilot found dead in the cockpit.

33
00:01:08,95 --> 00:01:11,91
Make it so.
Top priority. Quickly and carefully.

34
00:01:11,91 --> 00:01:13,41
We leave no trace.

35
00:01:13,41 --> 00:01:16,37
- What, you can't save him?
- There's nothing to save.

36
00:01:17,50 --> 00:01:19,08
He's had a massive stroke.

37
00:01:20,75 --> 00:01:22,83
What happened down on Two?

38
00:01:22,83 --> 00:01:26,79
A man who was just released on Four
ended up back on Two the next day.

39
00:01:26,79 --> 00:01:29,83
Word got out on the floor,
and then they killed them all.

40
00:01:30,58 --> 00:01:32,45
No one's getting out, are they?

41
00:01:32,45 --> 00:01:33,54
Not now.

42
00:01:34,29 --> 00:01:35,37
Not after this.

43
00:03:09,95 --> 00:03:12,75
We need to go tomorrow.

44
00:03:12,75 --> 00:03:14,20
- Tomorrow?
- You heard me.

45
00:03:15,91 --> 00:03:16,91
Go where?

46
00:03:17,50 --> 00:03:18,50
Anywhere.

47
00:03:18,50 --> 00:03:19,62
It has to be tomorrow.

48
00:03:20,50 --> 00:03:22,08
- Tomorrow.
- We can't wait.

49
00:03:22,08 --> 00:03:23,62
We'll never have a better chance.

50
00:03:25,20 --> 00:03:27,08
- You sound insane.
- No, listen to me.

51
00:03:28,12 --> 00:03:30,29
They don't have enough guards,
and they know it.

52
00:03:31,16 --> 00:03:33,50
They're afraid. Right now, they're afraid.

53
00:03:33,50 --> 00:03:34,87
Afraid? Afraid of what?

54
00:03:34,87 --> 00:03:37,45
They just killed a hundred men
to keep them quiet.

55
00:03:38,37 --> 00:03:40,66
- What would you call that?
- I'd call that power.

56
00:03:40,66 --> 00:03:43,29
Power? Power doesn't panic.

57
00:03:44,66 --> 00:03:48,29
Five thousand men are about to find out
they're never leaving here alive.

58
00:03:49,29 --> 00:03:52,37
Don't you think
that worries them upstairs?

59
00:03:53,33 --> 00:03:56,33
Whatever we're making here,
it's clearly something they need.

60
00:03:56,33 --> 00:03:59,54
They can't afford to be surprised again.

61
00:04:01,33 --> 00:04:04,16
There'll never be less guards
than tomorrow. You know that.

62
00:04:04,16 --> 00:04:05,25
On-Program.

63
00:04:05,25 --> 00:04:07,91
Everyday we wait, they get stronger.

64
00:04:07,91 --> 00:04:10,41
- It might be wise to have a plan.
- We have a plan.

65
00:04:10,66 --> 00:04:13,62
Oh, what? You and Birnok and Melshi?

66
00:04:13,62 --> 00:04:15,25
You don't have time to be stupid!

67
00:04:15,25 --> 00:04:16,33
Come on!

68
00:04:18,20 --> 00:04:20,62
The plan works around
the new man coming down.

69
00:04:22,00 --> 00:04:23,62
They'll replace Ulaf tomorrow.

70
00:04:24,83 --> 00:04:27,08
That might not happen again
until it's too late.

71
00:04:27,08 --> 00:04:31,75
I'd rather die trying to take them down
than die giving them what they want.

72
00:04:36,04 --> 00:04:37,45
We won't have a better chance.

73
00:04:39,66 --> 00:04:40,95
It has to be tomorrow.

74
00:04:42,58 --> 00:04:43,58
Program.

75
00:04:51,16 --> 00:04:53,00
<i>Home Blue,
proceed directly to your cell.</i>

76
00:04:53,00 --> 00:04:54,16
Keef, where is he?

77
00:04:54,16 --> 00:04:55,50
He's dead.

78
00:04:55,50 --> 00:04:56,58
He didn't make it?

79
00:04:56,58 --> 00:04:57,66
What happened?

80
00:04:57,66 --> 00:04:59,33
He's dead. Can't you see that?

81
00:04:59,33 --> 00:05:01,54
- Who was it?
- Ulaf, the old guy.

82
00:05:01,54 --> 00:05:03,12
New man tomorrow.

83
00:05:03,12 --> 00:05:04,58
What's going on?

84
00:05:04,58 --> 00:05:06,29
Tell them.

85
00:05:06,29 --> 00:05:07,62
Collapsed in the walk way.

86
00:05:07,62 --> 00:05:09,16
- Tell them!
- Tell us what?

87
00:05:09,83 --> 00:05:11,04
What happened?

88
00:05:11,04 --> 00:05:12,37
A doctor came out.

89
00:05:12,37 --> 00:05:14,00
He didn't do much, did he?

90
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:15,08
Kino?

91
00:05:15,08 --> 00:05:17,33
<i>We will have immediate
facility compliance</i>

92
00:05:17,33 --> 00:05:20,50
<i>or we will begin activating floors
without warning.</i>

93
00:05:20,50 --> 00:05:21,58
Keef! Floor!

94
00:05:23,45 --> 00:05:24,66
What's going on?

95
00:05:24,66 --> 00:05:26,70
The doctor told us
what happened down on Two.

96
00:05:26,70 --> 00:05:27,79
It's true, isn't it?

97
00:05:27,79 --> 00:05:29,08
They fried the whole bridge.

98
00:05:29,08 --> 00:05:30,37
It is worse than that.

99
00:05:31,16 --> 00:05:32,62
- It's why.
- Louder.

100
00:05:32,62 --> 00:05:34,54
He said they made a mistake,

101
00:05:34,54 --> 00:05:36,79
and sent back a man
who'd just been released.

102
00:05:36,79 --> 00:05:39,95
- They fried two shifts to keep it quiet.
- You heard him say this?

103
00:05:39,95 --> 00:05:41,29
How would he know?

104
00:05:41,29 --> 00:05:42,70
I don't believe it.

105
00:05:42,70 --> 00:05:44,50
He's a doctor,
they would never tell...

106
00:05:44,50 --> 00:05:47,37
No one is getting out!

107
00:06:03,25 --> 00:06:04,25
It's true.

108
00:06:05,87 --> 00:06:08,29
The rumors are true.

109
00:06:09,50 --> 00:06:10,62
He said it's true.

110
00:06:10,62 --> 00:06:12,04
They're not letting us go.

111
00:06:13,37 --> 00:06:14,45
Ever.

112
00:06:17,16 --> 00:06:18,87
We're gonna die here,

113
00:06:19,87 --> 00:06:21,00
or in the next place.

114
00:06:24,70 --> 00:06:27,25
So let's get out heads back in our cells,

115
00:06:29,25 --> 00:06:30,79
and start figuring this out.

116
00:06:40,29 --> 00:06:41,79
<i>Kreegyr's men took the bait.</i>

117
00:06:41,79 --> 00:06:43,79
They're asking for a landing bay.

118
00:06:44,37 --> 00:06:46,45
- They found it?
- They're towing it, sir.

119
00:06:46,45 --> 00:06:47,83
"Pilot dead. Ship adrift.

120
00:06:47,83 --> 00:06:49,50
"Port of origin unknown.

121
00:06:50,33 --> 00:06:54,12
"Kafrene Rescue Salvage
reports unresponsive, GPE 7000.

122
00:06:54,12 --> 00:06:58,75
"Operator appears to have frozen following
hydraulic failure on hyperspace re-entry."

123
00:06:58,75 --> 00:07:00,08
It worked.

124
00:07:00,08 --> 00:07:01,79
Now we hang back and wait.

125
00:07:01,79 --> 00:07:03,50
- Suggestion, sir?
- Yes.

126
00:07:03,50 --> 00:07:05,25
I don't think we should step away.

127
00:07:05,25 --> 00:07:07,33
- Go on.
- We should do what we normally do.

128
00:07:07,33 --> 00:07:10,75
Unidentified ship, dead pilot.
We'd want to take a look, wouldn't we?

129
00:07:10,75 --> 00:07:12,58
Let's assume Kreegyr's watching.

130
00:07:12,58 --> 00:07:15,75
The least suspicious thing to do
would be to take an interest.

131
00:07:15,75 --> 00:07:17,62
That is exactly what we will do.

132
00:07:38,12 --> 00:07:39,12
Listen up!

133
00:07:41,75 --> 00:07:44,95
We are done with counting shifts.

134
00:07:45,87 --> 00:07:48,37
There is only then and now.

135
00:07:49,79 --> 00:07:52,16
There is only one way out.

136
00:07:53,00 --> 00:07:54,08
Play it how you want.

137
00:07:55,50 --> 00:07:57,79
But I'm gonna assume I'm already dead,

138
00:07:58,83 --> 00:08:00,00
and take it from there.

139
00:08:00,79 --> 00:08:02,66
There's no sense
in warning the night shift.

140
00:08:03,66 --> 00:08:06,25
They'll hear about it
one way or another soon enough.

141
00:08:08,12 --> 00:08:09,37
Let's make it look good.

142
00:08:20,91 --> 00:08:22,91
<i>New protocol announcement.</i>

143
00:08:22,91 --> 00:08:28,04
<i>All skybridge transfers will be On-Program
and silent until further notice.</i>

144
00:08:28,62 --> 00:08:32,12
<i>Any shift not in full compliance
will be punished collectively.</i>

145
00:08:33,16 --> 00:08:34,58
<i>On-Program now.</i>

146
00:08:34,58 --> 00:08:36,20
On-Program!

147
00:08:40,04 --> 00:08:41,12
And turn.

148
00:08:50,12 --> 00:08:51,25
- Ready?
- Yeah.

149
00:09:19,87 --> 00:09:22,91
Doctor Mullmoy,
we're just not sure what to do.

150
00:09:23,58 --> 00:09:27,08
She needs her meds, she knows it,
but we caught her hiding them now,

151
00:09:27,08 --> 00:09:29,33
and when I asked her
what she thought she was up to

152
00:09:29,33 --> 00:09:31,25
she said your pills put her off of food,

153
00:09:31,25 --> 00:09:34,00
and she'd rather keep eating
than let you keep pretending.

154
00:09:34,00 --> 00:09:35,50
Okay, where is she?

155
00:09:36,91 --> 00:09:39,00
- It's over there.
- Got it. Thanks.

156
00:09:43,58 --> 00:09:46,91
I was here once, 30 years ago.

157
00:09:47,95 --> 00:09:49,33
I'd just left Chandrila,

158
00:09:49,33 --> 00:09:52,08
and my boss at the time
thought I'd enjoy seeing it.

159
00:09:52,08 --> 00:09:53,37
Has it changed much?

160
00:09:54,08 --> 00:09:55,08
I can't tell.

161
00:09:55,95 --> 00:09:57,50
Didn't pay enough attention.

162
00:09:57,50 --> 00:10:00,66
Suppose I thought
I'd be coming back regularly.

163
00:10:00,66 --> 00:10:02,00
It's State property.

164
00:10:02,00 --> 00:10:05,91
The rules are strict on décor.
Our choices for change are limited.

165
00:10:06,50 --> 00:10:08,00
It's a bit old, isn't it?

166
00:10:10,33 --> 00:10:11,79
I like new.

167
00:10:12,95 --> 00:10:15,29
I know it's tasteless and cliché,

168
00:10:15,29 --> 00:10:19,54
but one of the indulgences of great wealth
is freedom from other people's opinions.

169
00:10:20,66 --> 00:10:21,87
You've made your point.

170
00:10:22,45 --> 00:10:25,00
Yes, everyone says you're very direct.

171
00:10:25,00 --> 00:10:27,33
The Senator has many obligations,

172
00:10:27,33 --> 00:10:29,75
she's learned to manage
her time accordingly.

173
00:10:30,79 --> 00:10:32,33
I like when things are clear.

174
00:10:32,33 --> 00:10:36,83
But then I always get to thinking,
what's around the corner?

175
00:10:36,83 --> 00:10:40,41
Mmm, your curiosity
has clearly been profitable.

176
00:10:40,41 --> 00:10:42,75
I've met your husband several times.

177
00:10:42,75 --> 00:10:43,83
I'm sure.

178
00:10:45,50 --> 00:10:48,62
I take it that's not a corner
we're turning in this conversation.

179
00:10:48,62 --> 00:10:50,08
It is not.

180
00:10:51,00 --> 00:10:54,75
Many cultures don't fully appreciate
the clarity of the Chandrilan marriage.

181
00:10:54,75 --> 00:10:56,95
Even our own people are confused at times.

182
00:10:57,79 --> 00:10:59,45
Boundaries can be liberating.

183
00:11:00,58 --> 00:11:01,95
The old ways have value.

184
00:11:02,91 --> 00:11:03,95
Good.

185
00:11:03,95 --> 00:11:05,29
We understand each other.

186
00:11:06,45 --> 00:11:10,79
So, searching for a more
fluid banking situation, are we?

187
00:11:10,79 --> 00:11:13,08
We've discussed all this, Davo.

188
00:11:14,08 --> 00:11:15,54
I'd like to hear her say it.

189
00:11:19,87 --> 00:11:21,04
Yes.

190
00:11:21,04 --> 00:11:25,29
We're exploring alternative
financing arrangements for our foundation.

191
00:11:26,58 --> 00:11:28,66
As Tay has no doubt
already told you,

192
00:11:28,66 --> 00:11:30,75
we've reached a scale in our holdings

193
00:11:30,75 --> 00:11:33,04
that permits
a great variety of transactions

194
00:11:33,04 --> 00:11:37,79
to be bundled in ways
that make outside observation impossible.

195
00:11:37,79 --> 00:11:39,50
Yes, I've been informed.

196
00:11:40,41 --> 00:11:44,12
What's unfortunate
is that people such as yourself,

197
00:11:44,12 --> 00:11:46,16
those with immaculate reputations,

198
00:11:46,16 --> 00:11:49,20
sometimes feel that by taking advantage
of the opportunity

199
00:11:49,20 --> 00:11:51,12
they're somehow tarnished.

200
00:11:51,12 --> 00:11:52,45
The money is yours.

201
00:11:53,20 --> 00:11:54,95
Family wealth is a thing to be proud of

202
00:11:54,95 --> 00:11:58,70
and you ought to be able to move it
as you like with your privacy intact.

203
00:11:59,62 --> 00:12:03,87
The Empire's new regulations, made without
Senate consultation, I might add,

204
00:12:03,87 --> 00:12:06,62
are as cumbersome as they are avoidable.

205
00:12:06,62 --> 00:12:09,54
They've made a game of it and we play.

206
00:12:10,79 --> 00:12:13,16
This is a charitable fund
we're establishing.

207
00:12:13,16 --> 00:12:14,29
So I've been told.

208
00:12:16,25 --> 00:12:19,04
- What will it cost?
- My fee?

209
00:12:19,04 --> 00:12:21,83
We assume it's a percentage
of funds transferred.

210
00:12:21,83 --> 00:12:23,16
I want no fee.

211
00:12:23,16 --> 00:12:25,58
Money means very little to me
at this point.

212
00:12:26,75 --> 00:12:28,20
Charity, isn't it?

213
00:12:30,08 --> 00:12:31,91
- I insist.
- And I refuse.

214
00:12:31,91 --> 00:12:36,04
Please take no offense,
I'd prefer not to owe any favors.

215
00:12:36,75 --> 00:12:39,58
I'd feel far more comfortable
paying you for your trouble.

216
00:12:41,04 --> 00:12:44,83
A drop of discomfort
may be the price of doing business.

217
00:12:49,45 --> 00:12:50,75
Let's have it.

218
00:12:51,95 --> 00:12:54,00
I'd like a return invitation.

219
00:12:54,00 --> 00:12:56,50
I'd like to come back here at least once.

220
00:12:57,16 --> 00:12:59,87
I'm sure that's something
that can be arranged.

221
00:12:59,87 --> 00:13:01,83
I have a 14-year-old son.

222
00:13:01,83 --> 00:13:03,45
I'd like to bring him with me.

223
00:13:07,20 --> 00:13:08,62
You can't be serious.

224
00:13:10,29 --> 00:13:13,41
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?

225
00:13:13,41 --> 00:13:14,83
An introduction.

226
00:13:14,83 --> 00:13:17,29
Your daughter is 13.
She'll soon come of age.

227
00:13:17,95 --> 00:13:18,95
Two young people.

228
00:13:18,95 --> 00:13:21,66
Attractive and privileged
Chandrilan citizens.

229
00:13:22,66 --> 00:13:26,08
What makes you think
I approve of that tradition?

230
00:13:26,08 --> 00:13:31,50
Our position sometimes makes decisions
for us, don't you find, Senator?

231
00:13:31,50 --> 00:13:35,25
Neither of us have lived a life
that encourages nonconformity.

232
00:13:36,75 --> 00:13:38,95
Is that your only offer?

233
00:13:39,50 --> 00:13:40,50
I'm afraid so.

234
00:13:40,50 --> 00:13:41,83
Tay will see you out.

235
00:13:44,58 --> 00:13:45,79
Of course.

236
00:13:50,75 --> 00:13:53,45
- It's a lot to think about.
- I'm not thinking about it.

237
00:13:56,83 --> 00:13:59,08
That's the first untrue thing you've said.

238
00:14:00,87 --> 00:14:02,12
It's been a pleasure.

239
00:14:22,66 --> 00:14:24,41
There was a mark on the fountain.

240
00:14:25,00 --> 00:14:26,00
Could be anything.

241
00:14:26,83 --> 00:14:29,16
That's what I thought,
so I went to the stairs.

242
00:14:30,58 --> 00:14:32,12
The rail was gone.

243
00:14:32,12 --> 00:14:33,54
A clean break. Fresh.

244
00:14:34,95 --> 00:14:37,04
He wants a meeting, face to face.

245
00:14:37,83 --> 00:14:39,20
There goes the day.

246
00:14:39,20 --> 00:14:40,33
I don't like it.

247
00:14:40,33 --> 00:14:42,00
Not now, I don't like the timing.

248
00:14:42,00 --> 00:14:43,33
You don't like anything.

249
00:14:43,33 --> 00:14:45,54
At the very least
you need to let me go.

250
00:14:45,54 --> 00:14:48,08
Take the Fondor, go to safety
and I'll take care of it.

251
00:14:48,08 --> 00:14:49,95
You know that's not happening.

252
00:14:49,95 --> 00:14:51,41
Stop wasting time.

253
00:14:52,62 --> 00:14:53,83
It's been a year.

254
00:14:54,70 --> 00:14:56,58
I'm surprised he waited this long.

255
00:14:56,58 --> 00:14:58,20
Then if it's a trap?

256
00:14:58,20 --> 00:15:01,00
Oh, if it's a trap, we've already lost.

257
00:15:03,33 --> 00:15:04,33
Hands away.

258
00:15:05,70 --> 00:15:07,08
Are we really doing this?

259
00:15:08,12 --> 00:15:10,62
- You're still on board?
- I want out. Don't care how.

260
00:15:10,62 --> 00:15:12,00
I'm dead. I'm dead.

261
00:15:12,00 --> 00:15:13,79
- Hey, hey, hey!
- I'm pretending to be dead.

262
00:15:15,25 --> 00:15:17,33
Don't die until you put up a fight.

263
00:15:21,12 --> 00:15:22,50
One way out.

264
00:15:22,50 --> 00:15:23,66
Come on!

265
00:15:25,33 --> 00:15:26,66
Keep it moving!

266
00:15:29,20 --> 00:15:30,20
Come on!

267
00:15:31,75 --> 00:15:33,04
Pick it up.

268
00:15:41,20 --> 00:15:45,50
Right now, I'm two racks behind!

269
00:15:45,50 --> 00:15:51,20
And we are not
gonna close out the shift like that!

270
00:16:04,33 --> 00:16:05,50
Stop right there.

271
00:16:06,45 --> 00:16:09,58
On-Program. Hands on your head.
Eyes front. Feet down.

272
00:16:13,25 --> 00:16:14,45
Keep it moving!

273
00:16:16,25 --> 00:16:17,50
Come on, come on.

274
00:16:17,50 --> 00:16:18,87
Come on!

275
00:16:24,54 --> 00:16:26,12
Step forward, move, stop there.

276
00:16:26,54 --> 00:16:28,25
Zap-rod.

277
00:16:28,25 --> 00:16:30,62
If I have to use this,
you'll remember it, yes? Yes?

278
00:16:30,62 --> 00:16:32,33
We owe a check on Three.

279
00:16:32,33 --> 00:16:34,08
- Do that now.
- We're already behind.

280
00:16:34,08 --> 00:16:36,04
- Stepping off.
- You're good.

281
00:16:36,04 --> 00:16:38,08
I said eyes front.

282
00:16:38,08 --> 00:16:39,20
Where is he?

283
00:16:39,79 --> 00:16:41,33
- Are they even watching?
- Calm down.

284
00:16:41,33 --> 00:16:43,75
- How?
- I thought you were dead already.

285
00:16:57,58 --> 00:17:01,20
New man ready on 5-2-D,
requesting unit override.

286
00:17:01,20 --> 00:17:02,62
How's it looking out there?

287
00:17:02,62 --> 00:17:04,37
<i>Copy that, coming up.</i>

288
00:17:07,20 --> 00:17:08,20
Looks good.

289
00:17:10,29 --> 00:17:11,37
Okay, go.

290
00:17:40,16 --> 00:17:42,00
Oh, no.

291
00:17:49,45 --> 00:17:51,04
<i>On-Program.</i>

292
00:18:39,87 --> 00:18:41,00
<i>On-Program.</i>

293
00:18:41,00 --> 00:18:43,50
<i>New man on the floor.
Everyone hold positions.</i>

294
00:18:43,50 --> 00:18:45,29
New man on the floor!

295
00:18:45,29 --> 00:18:47,08
Hold your positions!

296
00:18:57,12 --> 00:18:58,62
Lift engaged.

297
00:19:05,83 --> 00:19:07,45
- What'd you say to me?
- I said nothing.

298
00:19:07,45 --> 00:19:09,70
If you wanna say something,
you should say it now.

299
00:19:09,70 --> 00:19:11,00
You start...

300
00:19:11,00 --> 00:19:13,62
Hey! You lot, back on program!

301
00:19:16,25 --> 00:19:18,58
You lot, back on program!

302
00:19:18,58 --> 00:19:20,62
Get back on program!

303
00:19:23,54 --> 00:19:25,12
Whoa, what's going on? What's that?

304
00:19:26,33 --> 00:19:27,54
Now!

305
00:19:31,50 --> 00:19:33,00
What's going on out there?

306
00:19:33,00 --> 00:19:34,79
Go! Go!

307
00:19:38,25 --> 00:19:40,95
- Clear the target.
- What are you doing?

308
00:19:53,66 --> 00:19:56,08
- Come on! Help them!
- Let's go!

309
00:19:56,08 --> 00:19:57,66
Attack!

310
00:20:22,54 --> 00:20:25,66
Spark the floor! Spark the floor!

311
00:20:25,66 --> 00:20:30,87
Get on the tables! Get up on the tables!

312
00:20:30,87 --> 00:20:32,00
Spark the floor!

313
00:20:40,20 --> 00:20:41,45
Talk to me!

314
00:20:44,20 --> 00:20:47,33
Right, are you all right?

315
00:20:49,33 --> 00:20:51,75
- You all right? You good?
- I'm okay.

316
00:20:52,58 --> 00:20:54,04
Attack!

317
00:20:56,16 --> 00:20:58,20
We have a situation on 5-2-D.

318
00:20:58,20 --> 00:21:00,12
Repeat, we have a situation...

319
00:21:11,41 --> 00:21:12,95
No! Xaul!

320
00:21:15,20 --> 00:21:16,20
Come on!

321
00:21:20,37 --> 00:21:21,37
Hey!

322
00:21:26,33 --> 00:21:27,33
They're down!

323
00:21:27,33 --> 00:21:29,45
Come on! Climb!

324
00:21:33,75 --> 00:21:34,95
We're in!

325
00:21:48,12 --> 00:21:49,12
Right.

326
00:21:49,62 --> 00:21:50,70
Gimme a hand.

327
00:21:55,66 --> 00:21:57,08
That's it. Go.

328
00:22:00,16 --> 00:22:01,37
Got it.

329
00:22:02,41 --> 00:22:04,29
- Hey, did you see that?
- Yeah, hold up.

330
00:22:04,29 --> 00:22:05,41
What's that?

331
00:22:05,41 --> 00:22:06,95
Where's that coming from?

332
00:22:09,50 --> 00:22:10,70
Hand it off.

333
00:22:12,91 --> 00:22:13,91
Move!

334
00:22:16,62 --> 00:22:18,95
- Kino, come on!
- We need to hold the level!

335
00:22:18,95 --> 00:22:20,70
- Let someone else do that.
- Go! Go!

336
00:22:20,70 --> 00:22:21,91
Blow the consoles!

337
00:22:21,91 --> 00:22:23,29
Keep the doors open!

338
00:22:25,75 --> 00:22:27,91
- <i>What's going on down there?</i>
- I'm not sure, Sir...

339
00:22:27,91 --> 00:22:29,50
<i>I'm looking at a water break.</i>

340
00:22:29,50 --> 00:22:31,41
I've got service warnings on every panel.

341
00:22:31,41 --> 00:22:33,45
<i>Get over there
and check it out. Now.</i>

342
00:22:33,45 --> 00:22:35,75
Check out 5-2-D. Now!

343
00:22:39,50 --> 00:22:40,62
Let's go. Okay.

344
00:22:41,37 --> 00:22:42,79
Go, go.

345
00:22:44,41 --> 00:22:46,66
- Jemboc!
- Taga, come on, let's go!

346
00:22:49,37 --> 00:22:50,41
Let's go!

347
00:22:51,08 --> 00:22:54,54
Let's go. Fall in. Come on.

348
00:22:54,54 --> 00:22:55,91
Go! Go! Go!

349
00:23:06,45 --> 00:23:07,91
One way out!

350
00:23:07,91 --> 00:23:10,16
Come and fight!

351
00:23:10,16 --> 00:23:11,54
What?

352
00:23:17,08 --> 00:23:18,08
Come on.

353
00:23:43,50 --> 00:23:45,95
- Ah!
- We're leaving! Join us!

354
00:23:53,08 --> 00:23:55,62
Climb! Use whatever you can!

355
00:23:58,91 --> 00:24:00,25
Go!

356
00:24:04,66 --> 00:24:07,25
<i>This is a facility-wide
emergency announcement.</i>

357
00:24:07,25 --> 00:24:11,12
<i>Complete program protocol
will commence in 40 seconds.</i>

358
00:24:11,12 --> 00:24:15,33
Any deviation or failure to comply
will result in unit-wide activation.

359
00:24:15,33 --> 00:24:17,58
- Start the count.
- Count engaged.

360
00:24:17,58 --> 00:24:19,58
How much longer
to find the water break?

361
00:24:19,58 --> 00:24:21,25
Techs waiting for a secure floor.

362
00:24:21,25 --> 00:24:22,50
Isolate Five.

363
00:24:22,50 --> 00:24:23,62
Locked in.

364
00:24:23,62 --> 00:24:27,12
5-5, 5-3, 5-6. Burn a firewall around it.

365
00:24:27,12 --> 00:24:29,37
Fry the whole Level.
Make the epicenter 5-2.

366
00:24:29,37 --> 00:24:30,45
Too late.

367
00:24:32,20 --> 00:24:35,16
- There's nobody there.
- You shouldn't be here.

368
00:24:36,16 --> 00:24:38,20
- Turn it off.
- Excuse me?

369
00:24:38,20 --> 00:24:39,45
Turn it off!

370
00:24:40,62 --> 00:24:42,20
That could mean so many things.

371
00:24:43,75 --> 00:24:45,91
I... I'll turn it off.

372
00:24:46,66 --> 00:24:47,66
Step away.

373
00:24:48,41 --> 00:24:49,66
Now!

374
00:24:51,16 --> 00:24:53,95
- Shut down the floors. Everywhere.
- Do it.

375
00:24:56,79 --> 00:24:57,79
No.

376
00:24:58,66 --> 00:24:59,83
Don't just turn it off.

377
00:25:00,91 --> 00:25:02,08
Cut the power.

378
00:25:02,08 --> 00:25:03,58
It's all hydro.

379
00:25:03,58 --> 00:25:06,83
Once we turn it off it takes months
to get it back up and running ag...

380
00:25:06,83 --> 00:25:08,12
I don't have it.

381
00:25:09,33 --> 00:25:10,58
He has the Hydro Gens.

382
00:25:42,75 --> 00:25:44,41
That's the backup power supply.

383
00:25:46,16 --> 00:25:47,20
Get out of there.

384
00:25:49,87 --> 00:25:50,87
There.

385
00:25:56,62 --> 00:25:57,62
With him.

386
00:25:58,45 --> 00:25:59,45
Move!

387
00:26:00,33 --> 00:26:02,70
On-Program! Now!

388
00:26:04,33 --> 00:26:05,41
All yours.

389
00:26:09,45 --> 00:26:10,45
Kino.

390
00:26:27,83 --> 00:26:29,00
Tell them what to do.

391
00:26:31,95 --> 00:26:33,08
It has to be you.

392
00:26:33,08 --> 00:26:34,20
Come on, Kino.

393
00:26:35,04 --> 00:26:36,75
You do this every day.

394
00:26:36,75 --> 00:26:38,62
Tell them what to do.

395
00:26:49,95 --> 00:26:52,50
My name is Kino Loy.

396
00:26:53,45 --> 00:26:56,95
<i>I'm the day shift manager on Level Five.</i>

397
00:26:58,75 --> 00:27:03,62
<i>I'm speaking to you
from the command center on Level Eight.</i>

398
00:27:06,08 --> 00:27:09,75
We are, at this moment,
in control of the facility.

399
00:27:12,83 --> 00:27:14,45
Is that the best you got?

400
00:27:18,04 --> 00:27:21,45
How long we hang on, how far we get,

401
00:27:22,41 --> 00:27:26,95
how many of us make it out,
all of that is now up to us.

402
00:27:28,45 --> 00:27:32,50
We have deactivated
every floor in the facility.

403
00:27:34,54 --> 00:27:36,95
<i>All floors are cold.</i>

404
00:27:40,00 --> 00:27:45,45
<i>Wherever you are right now,
get up, stop the work.</i>

405
00:27:45,45 --> 00:27:50,62
<i>Get out of your cells,
take charge and start climbing.</i>

406
00:27:50,62 --> 00:27:54,87
<i>They don't have enough guards
and they know it.</i>

407
00:27:54,87 --> 00:27:56,62
<i>If we wait until they figure that out,</i>

408
00:27:56,62 --> 00:27:57,75
it'll be too late.

409
00:28:00,16 --> 00:28:04,16
We will never have
a better chance than this

410
00:28:06,54 --> 00:28:10,29
and "I would rather die
trying to take them down

411
00:28:10,29 --> 00:28:12,91
"than giving them what they want."

412
00:28:14,20 --> 00:28:20,12
We know they fried
a hundred men on Level Two.

413
00:28:20,79 --> 00:28:26,04
We know that they are making up
our sentences as we go along.

414
00:28:26,04 --> 00:28:30,66
<i>We know that no one outside here
knows what's happening.</i>

415
00:28:31,37 --> 00:28:35,70
<i>And now we know,
that when they say we are being released,</i>

416
00:28:35,70 --> 00:28:39,91
we are being transferred
to some other prison

417
00:28:39,91 --> 00:28:45,54
to go and die and that ends today!

418
00:28:46,95 --> 00:28:49,70
There is one way out.

419
00:28:49,70 --> 00:28:54,58
Right now, the building is ours.

420
00:28:56,00 --> 00:29:00,33
You need to run, climb, kill!

421
00:29:00,45 --> 00:29:02,95
<i>You need to help each other.</i>

422
00:29:04,50 --> 00:29:07,20
<i>You see someone who's confused,
someone who is lost,</i>

423
00:29:08,37 --> 00:29:10,25
you get them moving
and you keep them moving

424
00:29:10,25 --> 00:29:13,41
until we put this place behind us.

425
00:29:14,58 --> 00:29:16,66
<i>There are 5,000 of us.</i>

426
00:29:17,62 --> 00:29:22,20
<i>If we can fight half as hard
as we've been working,</i>

427
00:29:22,20 --> 00:29:24,70
<i>we will be home in no time.</i>

428
00:29:26,58 --> 00:29:27,83
<i>One way out!</i>

429
00:29:28,62 --> 00:29:30,50
<i>One way out!</i>

430
00:29:31,54 --> 00:29:33,79
One way out!

431
00:29:33,79 --> 00:29:38,41
- One way out!
- One way out! One way out!

432
00:29:38,41 --> 00:29:41,91
One way out!
One way out! One way out...

433
00:29:41,91 --> 00:29:43,00
Come on!

434
00:29:44,25 --> 00:29:45,37
Let's get out of here!

435
00:30:04,12 --> 00:30:05,16
Quiet.

436
00:30:17,95 --> 00:30:19,16
One way out!

437
00:30:21,20 --> 00:30:24,25
Whatever happens now, we made it!

438
00:30:27,20 --> 00:30:28,37
What's wrong?

439
00:30:29,41 --> 00:30:30,41
Can't swim.

440
00:30:31,37 --> 00:30:33,33
- What?
- What did he say?

441
00:30:34,08 --> 00:30:35,33
I can't swim!

442
00:32:00,54 --> 00:32:04,00
<i>If this is a trap,
press the buttons for 215.</i>

443
00:32:07,33 --> 00:32:08,62
<i>We'll have privacy.</i>

444
00:32:08,62 --> 00:32:09,91
<i>We're running express.</i>

445
00:32:11,62 --> 00:32:13,62
<i>First of all, congratulations.</i>

446
00:32:15,66 --> 00:32:17,16
- On what?
- <i>Your daughter.</i>

447
00:32:17,16 --> 00:32:20,25
<i>Healthy. Beautiful. You must be pleased.</i>

448
00:32:24,83 --> 00:32:26,25
Is that meant to scare me?

449
00:32:26,25 --> 00:32:29,16
<i>Well, it's been a year
since we've had a chance to catch up.</i>

450
00:32:29,16 --> 00:32:30,50
<i>You've become a father.</i>

451
00:32:31,41 --> 00:32:33,41
<i>- It's not worth mentioning?</i>
- It's not fair.

452
00:32:34,79 --> 00:32:36,41
You knowing.

453
00:32:37,45 --> 00:32:38,62
Watching me.

454
00:32:40,25 --> 00:32:42,87
Do you ever think
how it might feel from my side?

455
00:32:42,87 --> 00:32:45,04
<i>I think about you constantly.</i>

456
00:32:48,58 --> 00:32:50,62
<i>Why are we here tonight, Lonni?</i>

457
00:32:50,62 --> 00:32:52,70
There's a new supervisor rising.

458
00:32:52,70 --> 00:32:54,08
Dedra Meero.

459
00:32:54,83 --> 00:32:57,29
She's focused
on a suspect she's calling Axis.

460
00:32:58,20 --> 00:32:59,95
She thinks he's building a rebel network.

461
00:32:59,95 --> 00:33:03,50
She started looking
into stolen Imperial Naval equipment

462
00:33:03,50 --> 00:33:07,04
and now she's looking
for a link to Aldhani.

463
00:33:08,41 --> 00:33:09,70
<i>Dedra Meero.</i>

464
00:33:10,62 --> 00:33:12,91
There was an incident on Ferrix
a few months ago.

465
00:33:12,91 --> 00:33:16,08
She thinks there's a link.
She's been tearing the place apart.

466
00:33:17,33 --> 00:33:21,87
They're searching
for a thief and the middleman.

467
00:33:22,12 --> 00:33:23,91
<i>Huh. "Axis."</i>

468
00:33:24,45 --> 00:33:26,62
She's gathering interest.
Partagaz likes her.

469
00:33:26,62 --> 00:33:28,04
<i>Well, this is good.</i>

470
00:33:28,04 --> 00:33:29,41
<i>Encourage this.</i>

471
00:33:31,37 --> 00:33:32,66
Why is this good?

472
00:33:32,66 --> 00:33:34,66
<i>Because she's wasting time.</i>

473
00:33:37,58 --> 00:33:39,45
You had nothing to do with Aldhani?

474
00:33:39,45 --> 00:33:42,25
<i>Well, almost nothing.
We were invited, but declined.</i>

475
00:33:43,00 --> 00:33:45,16
<i>They got lucky. We don't build on luck.</i>

476
00:33:46,45 --> 00:33:48,20
<i>But this can't be why you're here.</i>

477
00:33:53,66 --> 00:33:57,08
She just captured a Rebel pilot
running supplies for Anto Kreegyr.

478
00:33:57,95 --> 00:34:00,87
They turned him immediately
and staged an accident.

479
00:34:02,04 --> 00:34:04,75
We know that there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.

480
00:34:04,75 --> 00:34:06,83
If Kreegyr attacks, they'll be waiting.

481
00:34:08,54 --> 00:34:11,75
<i>And if he doesn't,
they'll know something's amiss.</i>

482
00:34:11,75 --> 00:34:13,37
They'll be slaughtered.

483
00:34:13,37 --> 00:34:14,66
<i>It's 50 men.</i>

484
00:34:15,29 --> 00:34:17,79
<i>- You're worth more than that.</i>
- You have to warn them.

485
00:34:17,79 --> 00:34:19,00
<i>To what end?</i>

486
00:34:19,00 --> 00:34:20,41
<i>Ruin everything?</i>

487
00:34:21,41 --> 00:34:23,41
<i>What better way to reassure the ISB</i>

488
00:34:23,41 --> 00:34:26,20
<i>there's no leak in security
than sacrificing Kreegyr.</i>

489
00:34:27,29 --> 00:34:30,16
<i>I'm doing this for you
as much as anything.</i>

490
00:34:44,79 --> 00:34:47,00
Tell me
why we're really here today, Lonni?

491
00:34:51,00 --> 00:34:52,62
I can't do this anymore.

492
00:34:54,37 --> 00:34:55,58
I'm a father now.

493
00:34:57,54 --> 00:34:59,33
I had no idea how it would feel.

494
00:35:01,37 --> 00:35:02,79
We took a vow.

495
00:35:06,79 --> 00:35:08,45
I'm giving you Dedra Meero.

496
00:35:09,75 --> 00:35:11,75
I'm giving you Spellhaus.

497
00:35:11,75 --> 00:35:14,33
I'm warning you about Ferrix.
I'm honoring my vow.

498
00:35:15,16 --> 00:35:17,33
I've been working my way
through there for six years.

499
00:35:18,33 --> 00:35:19,66
Working my way up.

500
00:35:20,70 --> 00:35:21,75
Alone.

501
00:35:24,58 --> 00:35:26,25
So, what was your plan?

502
00:35:27,45 --> 00:35:30,87
Gather a big basket of goodies for me
as a farewell gift?

503
00:35:34,50 --> 00:35:36,70
What were you planning to tell the ISB?

504
00:35:39,33 --> 00:35:40,33
My health.

505
00:35:42,00 --> 00:35:44,83
My wife's family has an import business.

506
00:35:44,83 --> 00:35:48,08
Even as you say the words,
you know it's impossible.

507
00:35:49,33 --> 00:35:50,95
We can't let you go, Lonni.

508
00:35:50,95 --> 00:35:52,25
We can't spare you.

509
00:35:52,87 --> 00:35:54,50
We've been grooming you for too long.

510
00:35:54,50 --> 00:35:56,12
And yes, you've been alone,

511
00:35:57,16 --> 00:36:00,83
but your career has profited greatly
from information that we've provided.

512
00:36:01,91 --> 00:36:03,70
Information that cost me dearly.

513
00:36:04,91 --> 00:36:06,16
You love your daughter.

514
00:36:06,87 --> 00:36:10,00
Kreegyr's men will be dying
to make sure she has a father.

515
00:36:11,37 --> 00:36:12,66
You're trapped, Lonni.

516
00:36:13,66 --> 00:36:16,62
There's no pleasure in saying it
but you're going nowhere.

517
00:36:18,66 --> 00:36:19,95
My sacrifice?

518
00:36:21,70 --> 00:36:24,29
It means nothing to you, does it?

519
00:36:26,25 --> 00:36:28,83
I said I think of you constantly and I do.

520
00:36:29,70 --> 00:36:32,91
Your investment in the Rebellion is epic.

521
00:36:32,91 --> 00:36:35,50
A double life? Every day a performance?

522
00:36:35,50 --> 00:36:37,50
The stress of that?

523
00:36:38,54 --> 00:36:40,75
We need heroes, Lonni, and here you are.

524
00:36:42,33 --> 00:36:43,95
And what do you sacrifice?

525
00:36:52,58 --> 00:36:53,58
Calm.

526
00:36:56,75 --> 00:36:58,41
Kindness. Kinship.

527
00:37:00,66 --> 00:37:01,66
Love.

528
00:37:04,20 --> 00:37:06,33
I've given up all chance at inner peace.

529
00:37:06,33 --> 00:37:08,41
I've made my mind a sunless space.

530
00:37:10,37 --> 00:37:12,79
I share my dreams with ghosts.

531
00:37:14,66 --> 00:37:17,79
I wake up every day
to an equation I wrote 15 years ago

532
00:37:17,79 --> 00:37:21,87
from which there's only one conclusion,
I'm damned for what I do.

533
00:37:23,20 --> 00:37:25,95
My anger, my ego,
my unwillingness to yield,

534
00:37:25,95 --> 00:37:27,87
my eagerness to fight,

535
00:37:27,87 --> 00:37:30,41
they've set me on a path
from which there is no escape.

536
00:37:31,08 --> 00:37:34,50
I yearned to be a savior against injustice
without contemplating the cost

537
00:37:34,50 --> 00:37:36,04
and by the time I looked down

538
00:37:36,66 --> 00:37:38,66
there was no longer
any ground beneath my feet.

539
00:37:38,66 --> 00:37:40,79
What is my sacrifice?

540
00:37:42,25 --> 00:37:46,75
I'm condemned to use
the tools of my enemy to defeat them.

541
00:37:46,75 --> 00:37:49,41
I burn my decency
for someone else's future.

542
00:37:49,41 --> 00:37:53,58
I burn my life to make a sunrise
that I know I'll never see.

543
00:37:54,58 --> 00:37:58,58
And the ego that started this fight
will never have a mirror

544
00:37:58,58 --> 00:38:01,83
or an audience or the light of gratitude.

545
00:38:03,33 --> 00:38:04,75
So what do I sacrifice?

546
00:38:07,29 --> 00:38:08,41
Everything!

547
00:38:16,20 --> 00:38:17,66
You'll stay with me, Lonni.

548
00:38:19,66 --> 00:38:21,66
I need all the heroes I can get.
