1
00:00:01,16 --> 00:00:02,58


2
00:00:02,66 --> 00:00:03,66
MAARVA: I'm not going.

3
00:00:04,25 --> 00:00:05,54
What are you talking about?

4
00:00:05,62 --> 00:00:08,87
You can't stay, and I can't go.

5
00:00:08,95 --> 00:00:10,79
I'll be worried about you all the time.

6
00:00:10,87 --> 00:00:12,00
That's just love.

7
00:00:12,75 --> 00:00:13,91


8
00:00:14,00 --> 00:00:16,16
-Six years.
-Six years?

9
00:00:16,25 --> 00:00:18,04
MAN: Welcome to Narkina Five.

10
00:00:18,12 --> 00:00:20,00
 No one's getting out, are they?

11
00:00:20,08 --> 00:00:21,91
-Not now.
-MON: I need a loan.

12
00:00:22,66 --> 00:00:25,95
-Davo Sculdun.
-MON: He's not a banker. He's a thug.

13
00:00:26,75 --> 00:00:27,75
What will it cost?

14
00:00:28,20 --> 00:00:31,04
I have a 14-year-old son.
I'd like to bring him with me.

15
00:00:31,41 --> 00:00:32,66
You can't be serious.

16
00:00:32,75 --> 00:00:33,87
Have you heard from Cinta?

17
00:00:34,54 --> 00:00:36,50
She's doing what she was told.

18
00:00:36,58 --> 00:00:39,08
Receiving messages
is just as dangerous as sending them.

19
00:00:39,16 --> 00:00:40,37
You should keep that in mind.

20
00:00:40,45 --> 00:00:42,29
SERGEANT MOSK: Sir... 

21
00:00:42,37 --> 00:00:43,91
We need to get out of here.

22
00:00:44,00 --> 00:00:45,95
 Sir, we need to get out of here!

23
00:00:46,04 --> 00:00:47,41
You didn't question the mother?

24
00:00:47,50 --> 00:00:49,16
DEDRA: If nothing else, she's our bait.

25
00:00:49,25 --> 00:00:51,37
She's the reason Andor came back.

26
00:00:51,45 --> 00:00:53,79

-Your breathing sounds weak.

27
00:00:53,87 --> 00:00:56,79
The doctor was here yesterday. 

28
00:00:57,16 --> 00:01:00,54
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?

29
00:01:00,70 --> 00:01:01,91


30
00:01:02,66 --> 00:01:07,12
I'd rather die trying to take them down
than die giving them what they want.

31
00:01:07,20 --> 00:01:08,54
Attack!

32
00:01:08,62 --> 00:01:09,62


33
00:01:10,33 --> 00:01:11,62


34
00:01:11,70 --> 00:01:14,87
 One way out! One way out!

35
00:01:14,95 --> 00:01:17,50
Whatever happens now, we made it!

36
00:01:18,54 --> 00:01:20,70
Anto Kreegyr. I want you to meet him.

37
00:01:20,79 --> 00:01:23,50
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.

38
00:01:23,58 --> 00:01:24,66
He'll need air support.

39
00:01:24,75 --> 00:01:26,79
-I work alone.
-That's what I'm trying to change.

40
00:01:26,87 --> 00:01:28,83
LUTHEN: Why are we here tonight, Lonni?

41
00:01:28,91 --> 00:01:29,91
HEERT: Dedra Meero,

42
00:01:30,00 --> 00:01:33,29
she just captured a rebel pilot
running supplies for Anto Kreegyr.

43
00:01:33,37 --> 00:01:36,41
We know that there's a raid planned
on the power station at Spellhaus.

44
00:01:36,50 --> 00:01:38,50
If Kreegyr attacks, they'll be waiting.

45
00:01:40,00 --> 00:01:42,83
LUTHEN: And if he doesn't,
they'll know something's amiss.

46
00:01:43,62 --> 00:01:44,62
They'll be slaughtered.

47
00:02:37,37 --> 00:02:41,79


48
00:02:48,87 --> 00:02:51,41


49
00:02:51,50 --> 00:02:54,00


50
00:02:54,08 --> 00:02:55,58
I can't feel my hands.

51
00:02:55,66 --> 00:02:57,66


52
00:02:57,75 --> 00:02:58,79
They're leaving.

53
00:02:58,87 --> 00:03:00,00
Stop sayin' that.

54
00:03:00,95 --> 00:03:02,16
They're leaving.

55
00:03:11,37 --> 00:03:12,91
MELSHI: I can't climb back up.

56
00:03:13,45 --> 00:03:15,50
-You hear me?
-CASSIAN: I hear you.

57
00:03:15,58 --> 00:03:16,62
MELSHI: My hands won't work.

58
00:03:16,70 --> 00:03:18,62
I said, "I hear you."

59
00:03:19,87 --> 00:03:23,29


60
00:03:23,37 --> 00:03:24,50
Tell me they're leaving.

61
00:03:25,70 --> 00:03:28,37
They're leaving. They're leaving.

62
00:03:30,66 --> 00:03:32,00
WOMAN 1: She looks so peaceful.

63
00:03:32,08 --> 00:03:34,66
WOMAN 2: Yeah.
Let's try and get some air in here.

64
00:03:34,75 --> 00:03:37,29
WOMAN 1: Oh, we're gonna have
to get rid of that bedding.

65
00:03:37,37 --> 00:03:39,66
-We'll save it for Cassian.
-WOMAN 2: Okay.

66
00:03:39,75 --> 00:03:41,33
WOMAN 1: She would have
wanted it that way.

67
00:03:41,91 --> 00:03:43,08
It's heartbreaking.

68
00:03:44,62 --> 00:03:45,79
What about the droid?

69
00:03:45,87 --> 00:03:47,29


70
00:03:47,37 --> 00:03:48,70


71
00:03:57,00 --> 00:03:59,58
WOMAN 2: Maybe we can just
put that to the side there.

72
00:04:02,16 --> 00:04:03,50
WOMAN 1: Let me.
WOMAN 2: Okay.

73
00:04:05,00 --> 00:04:07,87
We're gonna take her out in a minute,
if you want to say goodbye.

74
00:04:12,16 --> 00:04:15,66
I'll have them clear the room
if you want to be alone.

75
00:04:17,33 --> 00:04:19,83
B2EMO: I d-d-don't want to be alone.

76
00:04:19,91 --> 00:04:21,41
I want M-M-Maarva.

77
00:04:24,54 --> 00:04:26,62
WOMAN 1: Um,
they're gonna want to clear that.

78
00:04:28,41 --> 00:04:30,79
Jezzi's gonna be here 'till I get back.

79
00:04:30,87 --> 00:04:32,66
B2EMO: I can g-g-go with you.

80
00:04:34,87 --> 00:04:35,87
Jez?

81
00:04:35,95 --> 00:04:37,29
Yeah? Right here.

82
00:04:38,08 --> 00:04:39,66
Bee's gonna help you get organized.

83
00:04:39,75 --> 00:04:41,33
JEZZI: There's a lot to be done.

84
00:04:42,25 --> 00:04:44,25
B2EMO: You said I could g-g-go with you.

85
00:04:45,45 --> 00:04:48,79
The Daughters of Ferrix require
your assistance

86
00:04:48,87 --> 00:04:51,75
in matters of grave importance.

87
00:04:51,83 --> 00:04:53,37
JEZZI: We need to pull together, Bee.

88
00:04:54,08 --> 00:04:55,58
-All of us.


89
00:04:58,00 --> 00:04:59,04


90
00:05:05,45 --> 00:05:07,20


91
00:05:26,83 --> 00:05:31,04


92
00:05:49,33 --> 00:05:50,54
WOMAN: There she goes.

93
00:05:51,08 --> 00:05:53,62
That's sad. Taking her away. Ugh.

94
00:05:57,75 --> 00:05:58,95
CORV: Looks like someone died.

95
00:05:59,50 --> 00:06:00,54
It happens.

96
00:06:02,45 --> 00:06:03,45
Someone you know?

97
00:06:04,08 --> 00:06:05,33
CINTA: Just started last week.

98
00:06:05,70 --> 00:06:06,79


99
00:06:16,29 --> 00:06:17,87


100
00:06:20,58 --> 00:06:22,33


101
00:06:24,00 --> 00:06:25,50
It looks like it's just these two.

102
00:06:25,58 --> 00:06:26,91
They didn't walk here.

103
00:06:27,00 --> 00:06:28,12
Better if we go around...

104
00:06:29,00 --> 00:06:30,04
Yeah.

105
00:06:30,66 --> 00:06:31,66


106
00:06:33,45 --> 00:06:35,54


107
00:06:39,37 --> 00:06:42,45


108
00:06:42,54 --> 00:06:44,00
Hello.

109
00:06:44,08 --> 00:06:45,45
What is it?

110
00:06:45,54 --> 00:06:46,62
CASSIAN: It's a quadjumper.

111
00:06:48,04 --> 00:06:49,29
Can you fly it?

112
00:06:49,37 --> 00:06:51,50
I don't know. It's an old one.

113
00:06:51,58 --> 00:06:53,70



114
00:06:53,79 --> 00:06:55,00
Is that good?

115
00:06:55,87 --> 00:06:56,91
Do we have a choice?

116
00:07:03,00 --> 00:07:04,58
-Wait. Be careful.
-They can't see us.

117
00:07:04,66 --> 00:07:06,29
If they did,
they'd never get back in time.

118
00:07:06,37 --> 00:07:08,41
-What if someone's in there?
-We're getting out.

119
00:07:08,50 --> 00:07:09,87
-I know, I feel it.
-Wait.

120
00:07:12,16 --> 00:07:14,12


121
00:07:15,41 --> 00:07:17,41


122
00:07:19,62 --> 00:07:21,50


123
00:07:21,58 --> 00:07:23,87


124
00:07:26,29 --> 00:07:27,70


125
00:07:27,79 --> 00:07:29,12


126
00:07:36,45 --> 00:07:37,66
This was last night?

127
00:07:37,75 --> 00:07:39,20
They just moved the body.

128
00:07:39,29 --> 00:07:41,91
-Tell me we are watching this carefully.
-Full surveillance.

129
00:07:42,00 --> 00:07:43,41
What happens now?

130
00:07:43,50 --> 00:07:46,62
TIGO: As a prominent citizen of Ferrix,
she rates a big send-off.

131
00:07:47,58 --> 00:07:49,20
They'll want to close Rix Road.

132
00:07:49,29 --> 00:07:50,41
They'll ask for a permit.

133
00:07:50,50 --> 00:07:52,95
They know we won't allow it,
but they like to keep asking.

134
00:07:53,04 --> 00:07:54,66
They're building a list of grievances.

135
00:07:55,20 --> 00:07:57,16
We want a funeral.

136
00:07:57,25 --> 00:07:58,41
Excuse me?

137
00:07:58,50 --> 00:08:00,16
You're going to give them a permit.

138
00:08:00,75 --> 00:08:03,37
Keep it small, limit the time,
limit the numbers.

139
00:08:03,45 --> 00:08:06,70
We want to put them in a box,
stand back and watch.

140
00:08:07,95 --> 00:08:09,08
As you wish.

141
00:08:09,87 --> 00:08:11,08
How much time do we have?

142
00:08:11,66 --> 00:08:14,04
CORV: Two days. That's the Ferrix custom.

143
00:08:14,87 --> 00:08:15,91
What's that?

144
00:08:16,66 --> 00:08:17,87
The dead are bricked.

145
00:08:17,95 --> 00:08:20,62
They mix your ashes
with mortar and local stone dust,

146
00:08:20,70 --> 00:08:22,33
put your name on and fire it up.

147
00:08:22,41 --> 00:08:24,00
You become a block of Ferrix brick.

148
00:08:24,08 --> 00:08:25,41
And then what?

149
00:08:26,70 --> 00:08:27,83
They find you a wall.

150
00:08:31,08 --> 00:08:32,58


151
00:08:32,66 --> 00:08:35,54
 Mysie my.


152
00:08:35,62 --> 00:08:37,66
Prison, haye? Escapers.

153
00:08:37,75 --> 00:08:38,95
Toosie-two.

154
00:08:39,04 --> 00:08:41,20
A thousand each the offer be.

155
00:08:41,29 --> 00:08:42,91
One for each of us, Freedi.

156
00:08:43,00 --> 00:08:44,29


157
00:08:44,37 --> 00:08:47,54
Better fishing on land these times, haye?

158
00:08:47,62 --> 00:08:48,62


159
00:08:48,70 --> 00:08:50,58
Killed our water then, haye?

160
00:08:50,66 --> 00:08:52,20
 What?

161
00:08:52,29 --> 00:08:55,12
Not much squiggly now. Not much left.

162
00:08:55,20 --> 00:08:56,95
We meant you no harm.

163
00:08:57,04 --> 00:08:58,58
We killed nothing. Nothing.

164
00:08:58,66 --> 00:09:00,75
Prison done it. Spoilt our water.

165
00:09:00,83 --> 00:09:03,08
All our water.
Haye, Freedi?

166
00:09:03,16 --> 00:09:04,16


167
00:09:04,29 --> 00:09:07,91
No biggy dinner tonight
like past times, Freedi?

168
00:09:08,00 --> 00:09:09,08


169
00:09:09,16 --> 00:09:11,87
Haye. Water spoil here and far.

170
00:09:11,95 --> 00:09:14,83
-All your scobbin prison.
-That's the Empire.

171
00:09:14,91 --> 00:09:17,54
-We were trapped. We were trapped there.
-It's their prison.

172
00:09:17,62 --> 00:09:20,08
Ah, always the Empire, haye?

173
00:09:20,16 --> 00:09:23,16



174
00:09:23,25 --> 00:09:24,70
What? What is he saying?

175
00:09:25,29 --> 00:09:26,50
What, what is he saying?

176
00:09:26,58 --> 00:09:29,12
He's saying, alive or dead,
the offer goes.

177
00:09:29,20 --> 00:09:31,00
-Toosie-two.
-Wait slow down, hey, hang on!

178
00:09:31,08 --> 00:09:32,83
No, no, no. Let's talk. Let's talk.

179
00:09:32,91 --> 00:09:34,75
-MELSHI: Hang on.
-Kill anyone they would.

180
00:09:34,83 --> 00:09:36,95
Kill the water. Kill the squigglies.

181
00:09:37,04 --> 00:09:38,12


182
00:09:39,29 --> 00:09:41,70
Care not a snod who they kill, haye?

183
00:09:41,79 --> 00:09:42,79


184
00:09:43,58 --> 00:09:45,12
Scob the Empire.

185
00:09:45,20 --> 00:09:46,70
They not be killing ye.

186
00:09:46,79 --> 00:09:48,83
Naye today.

187
00:09:48,91 --> 00:09:51,00


188
00:09:51,08 --> 00:09:53,16
Wise to be jumping quickly, though.

189
00:09:53,25 --> 00:09:54,83


190
00:09:54,91 --> 00:09:57,91
Where ye be looking to run now, eh?

191
00:09:58,00 --> 00:09:59,00


192
00:09:59,75 --> 00:10:01,50


193
00:10:03,12 --> 00:10:04,70
-Niamos?
-ALIEN: Oh.

194
00:10:04,79 --> 00:10:09,12
Niamos. Haye. Niamos.

195
00:10:09,20 --> 00:10:11,54
ALIEN: Oh, yeah. 

196
00:10:11,62 --> 00:10:12,66


197
00:10:14,04 --> 00:10:16,75


198
00:10:20,79 --> 00:10:24,29


199
00:10:28,87 --> 00:10:30,75


200
00:10:30,83 --> 00:10:32,54


201
00:11:03,66 --> 00:11:04,83


202
00:11:10,66 --> 00:11:11,70


203
00:11:16,16 --> 00:11:17,16
KLEYA: Can I help you?

204
00:11:17,25 --> 00:11:20,20
My cousin. I understand she shops here.

205
00:11:21,37 --> 00:11:22,45
Senator Mothma?

206
00:11:25,08 --> 00:11:26,08
Are we alone?

207
00:11:27,12 --> 00:11:29,20


208
00:11:29,29 --> 00:11:30,95
You'd like to get something for her?

209
00:11:36,41 --> 00:11:37,66
We have some new pieces in.

210
00:11:37,75 --> 00:11:39,16
Where is he?

211
00:11:39,25 --> 00:11:40,83
She's been collecting jewelry.

212
00:11:40,91 --> 00:11:42,29
I don't have time for this.

213
00:11:48,33 --> 00:11:50,12
We have rules for a reason.

214
00:11:50,20 --> 00:11:52,12
-You don't seem to understand that.


215
00:11:53,50 --> 00:11:54,83
VEL: I sent up a flag this morning.

216
00:11:54,91 --> 00:11:56,91
-We would have seen it tomorrow.
-VEL: We?

217
00:11:57,50 --> 00:11:58,62
The Fondor's gone.

218
00:11:59,66 --> 00:12:01,25
Checked the back on the way in.

219
00:12:03,37 --> 00:12:05,25
Everything you're doing
right now is wrong.

220
00:12:05,95 --> 00:12:08,25
Tomorrow is too late. Where is he?

221
00:12:08,83 --> 00:12:11,25
You're off the rails.
You're lucky he's not here.

222
00:12:11,33 --> 00:12:12,70


223
00:12:12,79 --> 00:12:14,04
I gave him Aldhani.

224
00:12:16,08 --> 00:12:17,41
What have you done lately?

225
00:12:29,12 --> 00:12:30,25
I don't have lately.

226
00:12:31,33 --> 00:12:32,37
I have always.

227
00:12:32,87 --> 00:12:36,41
I have a constant blur of plates spinning
and knives on the floor,

228
00:12:36,50 --> 00:12:39,83
and needy, panicked faces at the window,
of which you are but one of many.

229
00:12:44,66 --> 00:12:45,95


230
00:12:46,04 --> 00:12:47,08
What information?

231
00:12:51,87 --> 00:12:53,75
I'll make sure
he knows where it came from.

232
00:12:57,29 --> 00:12:59,41
 Cassian Andor.

233
00:13:00,29 --> 00:13:01,50
The mother died.

234
00:13:02,87 --> 00:13:04,45
I'm leaving in the morning.

235
00:13:04,54 --> 00:13:06,37
Cinta says it's very busy there.

236
00:13:10,66 --> 00:13:11,66


237
00:13:12,79 --> 00:13:13,79
I'll let him know.

238
00:13:15,33 --> 00:13:16,33
Do that.

239
00:13:37,29 --> 00:13:39,37


240
00:13:52,95 --> 00:13:54,04


241
00:13:55,08 --> 00:13:56,45
B2EMO: I am glad you're back.

242
00:13:56,54 --> 00:13:57,75


243
00:13:59,50 --> 00:14:02,04


244
00:14:02,75 --> 00:14:05,37
Big man's on site. I want full coverage.

245
00:14:05,45 --> 00:14:07,00
Spotters front and back.

246
00:14:07,08 --> 00:14:09,83
I want to know immediately
about any comings and goings,

247
00:14:09,91 --> 00:14:12,20
visitors, deliveries, anything.

248
00:14:12,29 --> 00:14:13,29


249
00:14:13,37 --> 00:14:15,91


250
00:14:16,00 --> 00:14:17,00


251
00:14:30,95 --> 00:14:32,50


252
00:14:34,50 --> 00:14:36,04
Bee, time to go.

253
00:14:36,58 --> 00:14:37,62
B2EMO: G-G-Go where?

254
00:14:38,37 --> 00:14:40,83
Back to my place.
I have work in the morning.

255
00:14:41,33 --> 00:14:44,12
-B2EMO: I'm charging.
-You've been there all day.

256
00:14:46,29 --> 00:14:48,95
I'll take the afternoon off.
We'll come back tomorrow.

257
00:14:51,70 --> 00:14:54,87
She's not here, Bee.
She's in the stone now.

258
00:14:58,16 --> 00:14:59,16
She's on her way.

259
00:14:59,25 --> 00:15:02,16
B2EMO: 
I can w-w-wait to make sure.

260
00:15:04,25 --> 00:15:07,29
I can't leave you here alone.
She wouldn't want that.

261
00:15:09,95 --> 00:15:11,70
B2EMO: You could stay.

262
00:15:17,20 --> 00:15:18,66


263
00:15:18,75 --> 00:15:19,79
One night.

264
00:15:25,41 --> 00:15:27,00


265
00:15:31,20 --> 00:15:32,37


266
00:15:34,50 --> 00:15:36,37
GORST: 
They make a sound as they die.

267
00:15:36,45 --> 00:15:41,75
A sort of choral, agonized pleading.

268
00:15:42,58 --> 00:15:45,50
If you're having difficulty speaking,
just shake your head.

269
00:15:48,08 --> 00:15:49,12
Doesn't take long.

270
00:15:50,83 --> 00:15:53,37


271
00:15:53,45 --> 00:15:55,00
GORST: It won't feel that way to you.

272
00:15:56,70 --> 00:15:58,41


273
00:16:02,87 --> 00:16:06,00
KEYSAX: Bix, care to join me?

274
00:16:06,08 --> 00:16:08,16


275
00:16:08,25 --> 00:16:11,41


276
00:16:20,66 --> 00:16:22,41


277
00:16:33,75 --> 00:16:37,50
I'm going to ask you a question.
I expect an honest answer.

278
00:16:39,08 --> 00:16:42,00
If I'm not sure it's the truth,
I'll have to call back Dr. Gorst.

279
00:16:46,87 --> 00:16:48,37


280
00:16:48,45 --> 00:16:50,20
Anto Kreegyr.

281
00:16:52,75 --> 00:16:57,70
That name, this face, have a good look.

282
00:17:06,16 --> 00:17:09,79
 Is this the man
you introduced to Cassian Andor?

283
00:17:10,79 --> 00:17:11,87


284
00:17:12,91 --> 00:17:13,91
CORV: Bix.

285
00:17:18,75 --> 00:17:19,79


286
00:17:25,62 --> 00:17:26,70


287
00:17:26,79 --> 00:17:31,12
CHILDREN: "Yielding in acceptance.
Safe in the braid of the old ways.

288
00:17:31,25 --> 00:17:32,95


289
00:17:33,04 --> 00:17:37,29
"True and steady and braided in trust."

290
00:17:37,37 --> 00:17:43,08
"The old ways hold us.
Safe in the knot, in the binding.

291
00:17:43,16 --> 00:17:45,16
"The old ways teach us.

292
00:17:46,29 --> 00:17:49,70
"Bound against the wind, tied to shore.

293
00:17:49,79 --> 00:17:52,54
-"Tethered in permanence..."
-Seriously? Is that really happening?

294
00:17:52,62 --> 00:17:54,62
-We did it.
-You did it.

295
00:17:55,83 --> 00:17:57,16
I thought this was over.

296
00:17:57,25 --> 00:17:59,41
It's back.
You're not following the trends.

297
00:18:00,20 --> 00:18:02,33
It's weird.
It's stronger here than it is at home.

298
00:18:02,41 --> 00:18:04,83
-But you, you can do what you want.
-It's not me.

299
00:18:04,91 --> 00:18:06,50
-ELDER: Leida.
-"True and steady..."

300
00:18:06,58 --> 00:18:08,00
-Perrin?
-"...and braided in trust."

301
00:18:08,08 --> 00:18:10,66
No, no,
he's strangely open-minded on this topic.

302
00:18:10,75 --> 00:18:11,95
It's her, it's Leida.

303
00:18:12,04 --> 00:18:13,91
LEIDA: "...in the knot, in the binding."

304
00:18:14,00 --> 00:18:16,45
-Oh, no.
-She loves it.

305
00:18:17,37 --> 00:18:22,08
And her friends. It's the only thing
she shows up on time for, it's mad.

306
00:18:22,16 --> 00:18:25,91
"Yielding in acceptance.
Safe in the braid of the..."

307
00:18:26,00 --> 00:18:29,58
-I can't believe this.
-She found the elder.

308
00:18:29,66 --> 00:18:33,29
CHILDREN: "...braided in trust.
The old ways hold us.

309
00:18:33,37 --> 00:18:36,20
"Safe in the knot, in the binding."

310
00:18:36,29 --> 00:18:38,25
Don't tell me you're taking proposals.

311
00:18:38,83 --> 00:18:41,04
-CHILDREN: "Bound against the wind...


312
00:18:41,12 --> 00:18:42,95
I'm in so much trouble, Vel.

313
00:18:43,04 --> 00:18:47,50
CHILDREN: "...Tethered in permanence.
Yielding in acceptance."

314
00:18:49,37 --> 00:18:51,50
MON: Last year,
I was pulling 100,000 credits

315
00:18:51,58 --> 00:18:54,29
every month from the family trust
without a trace.

316
00:18:54,37 --> 00:18:57,62
VEL: For Luthen?
I had no idea it was that much.

317
00:18:59,29 --> 00:19:01,20
It was so easy. I did it myself.

318
00:19:01,62 --> 00:19:04,33
Set up a stream of accounts.
It was like water running downhill.

319
00:19:04,41 --> 00:19:07,12
I'd empty the bottom,
and it would just flow. No one the wiser.

320
00:19:07,75 --> 00:19:08,83


321
00:19:10,20 --> 00:19:13,45
MON: A few months ago, I was contacted
by one of the bankers back home,

322
00:19:14,33 --> 00:19:16,58
I was warned that Imperial inspectors

323
00:19:16,66 --> 00:19:19,41
might be taking a close look
at Chandrilan accounts.

324
00:19:20,50 --> 00:19:23,62
He said they were contacting clients
to make sure everything was in order.

325
00:19:25,91 --> 00:19:27,25
I did what I could.

326
00:19:27,33 --> 00:19:30,25
I pulled everything I could access
up the hill into the main account.

327
00:19:32,29 --> 00:19:36,58
There was one empty ledger at the end
of the line that was off-balance.

328
00:19:38,45 --> 00:19:43,45
But it was so obscure
and I just didn't know what else to do.

329
00:19:43,54 --> 00:19:44,62
I was nervous.

330
00:19:45,37 --> 00:19:48,33
I went to Luthen. I told him
that I needed help from the outside,

331
00:19:48,41 --> 00:19:50,16
-that I knew the risk...
-Tay Kolma.

332
00:19:51,00 --> 00:19:53,33
-Yes.
-VEL: Hmm.

333
00:19:55,12 --> 00:19:56,12
And you trust him?

334
00:19:57,04 --> 00:19:58,08


335
00:19:58,79 --> 00:19:59,87
Yes, I do.

336
00:20:02,87 --> 00:20:04,04
 But then, Aldhani.

337
00:20:06,79 --> 00:20:08,62
Now, suddenly everything was frozen.

338
00:20:09,91 --> 00:20:14,41
 I thought
Tay could help me replace the credits

339
00:20:14,50 --> 00:20:16,25
and get me started again,

340
00:20:16,33 --> 00:20:19,54
but what he really did was discover
just how much more trouble I was in.

341
00:20:19,62 --> 00:20:22,20


342
00:20:25,95 --> 00:20:26,95
Here I am.

343
00:20:28,95 --> 00:20:30,25


344
00:20:30,95 --> 00:20:32,04
How much is missing?

345
00:20:33,62 --> 00:20:34,95
Four hundred thousand.

346
00:20:36,12 --> 00:20:37,12


347
00:20:38,33 --> 00:20:41,12
-And they're looking into this when?
-MON: Soon. Very soon.

348
00:20:43,83 --> 00:20:44,83


349
00:20:49,87 --> 00:20:50,95
Does Luthen know?

350
00:20:54,20 --> 00:20:57,33
Some? No. Not really.

351
00:20:58,20 --> 00:20:59,50


352
00:21:01,20 --> 00:21:02,20
He warned me.

353
00:21:05,33 --> 00:21:06,79
Who knows what he knows.

354
00:21:08,29 --> 00:21:10,33
-This can't be exposed.
-I know that.

355
00:21:11,87 --> 00:21:13,04


356
00:21:19,45 --> 00:21:20,79
I found a solution.

357
00:21:24,45 --> 00:21:25,54


358
00:21:26,62 --> 00:21:27,70
LEIDA: Auntie Vel.

359
00:21:31,91 --> 00:21:34,33
-There you are.
-What are you doing here?

360
00:21:34,41 --> 00:21:36,29
Well, come back to see you.

361
00:21:37,95 --> 00:21:39,87
Hello. How have you been?

362
00:21:39,95 --> 00:21:43,45
-Good. I'm well. How are you?
-You are as nearly as tall as me.

363
00:21:43,54 --> 00:21:44,54


364
00:21:44,62 --> 00:21:47,37
VEL: What were you doing in there?
LEIDA: Practicing the chant.

365
00:21:47,45 --> 00:21:48,79
VEL: Huh. How's that going?

366
00:21:51,00 --> 00:21:52,87


367
00:21:54,04 --> 00:21:55,29
Call for you.

368
00:22:00,79 --> 00:22:02,04


369
00:22:02,12 --> 00:22:03,37


370
00:22:03,45 --> 00:22:06,50
-Sir? Is that you, sir?


371
00:22:06,87 --> 00:22:08,83
Yes. Hello, Sergeant.

372
00:22:08,91 --> 00:22:11,16
SERGEANT MOSK:
Apologies, sir. And to the family.

373
00:22:11,62 --> 00:22:14,54
What? Good to see you.

374
00:22:14,62 --> 00:22:18,08
SERGEANT MOSK: Yes. Yes, I think so.
I'm on the night shift here.

375
00:22:18,16 --> 00:22:20,62
There's a line at the break
to use this thing.

376
00:22:20,70 --> 00:22:24,12
Brevity's encouraged,
so forgive me if I'm a bit hasty.

377
00:22:24,20 --> 00:22:25,33
I can barely hear you.

378
00:22:25,41 --> 00:22:27,91
SERGEANT MOSK:
Yes, Morlana One. Still here.

379
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:29,04
Just speak clearly.

380
00:22:29,12 --> 00:22:32,04
Indeed. Been a bit rugged for me lately,

381
00:22:32,12 --> 00:22:34,87
but, you know, we're marching onward.

382
00:22:34,95 --> 00:22:36,95


383
00:22:37,16 --> 00:22:38,41
It's a smelter.

384
00:22:40,25 --> 00:22:42,45
There we go. Refueling.

385
00:22:42,54 --> 00:22:44,91
Should give us a moment. 

386
00:22:45,00 --> 00:22:48,66
Andor. I'm calling about Andor.
You wanted news if I had it.

387
00:22:48,75 --> 00:22:49,91
Yes. Please, go on.

388
00:22:50,50 --> 00:22:53,16
SERGEANT MOSK: Still a few Pre-Mor
holdouts working in the office

389
00:22:53,25 --> 00:22:55,50
helping with the Imperial transition.

390
00:22:55,58 --> 00:22:58,37
My old partner
still working the HQ night desk.

391
00:22:58,45 --> 00:23:01,45
He found me this afternoon
and he told me that...

392
00:23:01,66 --> 00:23:03,54


393
00:23:03,62 --> 00:23:04,66
Has he been caught?

394
00:23:04,75 --> 00:23:07,41
-The mother.
-SYRIL: You were talking about Andor.

395
00:23:08,37 --> 00:23:10,62
Yeah, she's passed away.

396
00:23:10,70 --> 00:23:11,75
Andor's mother?

397
00:23:11,83 --> 00:23:14,58
SERGEANT MOSK: There's lots of back
and forth with Coruscant about it.

398
00:23:14,66 --> 00:23:17,83
-So, are you saying that he's there?
-SERGEANT MOSK: No, no, I'm in Morlana.

399
00:23:17,91 --> 00:23:19,08
Where is Andor?

400
00:23:19,16 --> 00:23:23,20
Yes. Yes, that's it.
That he might show up at the funeral.

401
00:23:24,00 --> 00:23:25,00
When?

402
00:23:25,08 --> 00:23:27,54
SERGEANT MOSK: 
If he's not getting there, sir, has to...

403
00:23:27,62 --> 00:23:30,29
Factored... I wouldn't put it past him.
Not what we've been through.

404
00:23:30,37 --> 00:23:32,50
-We need to speak further.


405
00:23:32,58 --> 00:23:35,29
-I knew you'd want to...


406
00:23:35,37 --> 00:23:36,66


407
00:23:38,50 --> 00:23:41,50
The mystery of your former triumphs
have been vanquished.

408
00:23:41,58 --> 00:23:44,20
 I can sleep peacefully now.

409
00:23:46,79 --> 00:23:48,20


410
00:23:52,12 --> 00:23:53,41


411
00:24:00,70 --> 00:24:04,79


412
00:24:10,62 --> 00:24:13,37


413
00:24:15,04 --> 00:24:16,08


414
00:24:22,79 --> 00:24:24,62


415
00:24:28,54 --> 00:24:30,04
NEMIK:  Tyranny requi...

416
00:24:31,66 --> 00:24:33,37


417
00:24:47,58 --> 00:24:49,12


418
00:24:56,12 --> 00:24:58,12


419
00:25:00,62 --> 00:25:02,12
What's all this?

420
00:25:02,20 --> 00:25:04,12


421
00:25:04,37 --> 00:25:05,41
Good to know.

422
00:25:09,87 --> 00:25:11,37
Put it down or give it back.

423
00:25:24,25 --> 00:25:26,70

-I'm in. I'll do it.

424
00:25:27,20 --> 00:25:29,25
-Do what?
-SAW: Spellhaus power station.

425
00:25:29,87 --> 00:25:31,37
Tell Kreegyr I'm in.

426
00:25:32,08 --> 00:25:36,87
Tell him I'll bring air power,
but we take tactical orders from no one.

427
00:25:36,95 --> 00:25:39,37
You've taken a long time
coming back to me, Saw.

428
00:25:39,91 --> 00:25:41,75
We get to loot the eastern garrison.

429
00:25:41,83 --> 00:25:45,66
Whatever we can carry off.
And I want all the gear that you promised.

430
00:25:46,62 --> 00:25:48,66
You're too late. He's going tomorrow.

431
00:25:48,75 --> 00:25:50,50
We'll be ready. We have charts.

432
00:25:51,04 --> 00:25:53,33
All he has to do
is tell us when he wants it,

433
00:25:53,41 --> 00:25:57,33
and agree to my terms. Make it happen.

434
00:26:02,54 --> 00:26:03,66
I think not.

435
00:26:06,33 --> 00:26:07,41
Why?

436
00:26:08,87 --> 00:26:10,29
You were so eager for it.

437
00:26:10,75 --> 00:26:13,45
ISB knows Kreegyr's plan.
They'll be waiting for him.

438
00:26:16,91 --> 00:26:18,20
And how do we know this?

439
00:26:18,29 --> 00:26:19,45
I won't tell you that.

440
00:26:21,95 --> 00:26:24,37
And Kreegyr, he doesn't know.

441
00:26:29,45 --> 00:26:31,66
-How do you know I won't tell him?
-I don't.

442
00:26:31,75 --> 00:26:33,16
I don't know what you'll do.

443
00:26:34,16 --> 00:26:35,50


444
00:26:37,08 --> 00:26:38,95
It's far from ideal for either of us.

445
00:26:43,70 --> 00:26:46,00
You're willing to burn him.

446
00:26:47,45 --> 00:26:48,87
You're the random factor.

447
00:26:49,37 --> 00:26:51,91
-It's 30 men.
-Plus Kreegyr.

448
00:26:52,00 --> 00:26:53,50
SAW: So, you know he's doomed.

449
00:26:55,33 --> 00:26:57,29
Which means either you're ISB

450
00:26:57,37 --> 00:27:00,54
or you have someone inside
that you are protecting.

451
00:27:00,62 --> 00:27:02,33
Or I'm just a very good listener.

452
00:27:03,50 --> 00:27:06,54
You think it's worth losing Kreegyr?

453
00:27:10,04 --> 00:27:11,91
I did. I'm not sure right now.

454
00:27:12,00 --> 00:27:14,79
What if it was me instead of Kreegyr?
What would you do?

455
00:27:14,87 --> 00:27:17,70
Kreegyr doesn't know me.
I'm not vulnerable if he's captured.

456
00:27:18,54 --> 00:27:20,16
-Surely you've met him.
-LUTHEN: I've met him.

457
00:27:20,25 --> 00:27:22,75
I've been in a room with him,
but he doesn't know that.

458
00:27:22,83 --> 00:27:26,41
We send people. We drop supplies.
We have special radios. He can't hurt me.

459
00:27:26,50 --> 00:27:27,50
Like I can.

460
00:27:34,83 --> 00:27:36,50
It's your decision, Saw.

461
00:27:38,54 --> 00:27:39,75
It's your decision.

462
00:27:40,91 --> 00:27:41,91
But know the choice.

463
00:27:42,54 --> 00:27:44,75
Do we let Kreegyr
go down and play the long game,

464
00:27:44,83 --> 00:27:48,79
or do we warn him and throw away a source
that's taken years to cultivate?

465
00:27:51,50 --> 00:27:53,91
You have people everywhere, don't you?

466
00:27:54,00 --> 00:27:56,54
-You're avoiding the question.
-SAW: All of your sources...

467
00:27:56,62 --> 00:27:57,62
Try to concentrate.

468
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:01,50
There's someone with Kreegyr?

469
00:28:02,29 --> 00:28:05,79
Someone at ISB?
Maybe there's someone here with me.

470
00:28:06,75 --> 00:28:08,83
-You're wasting time.
-Why wouldn't you?

471
00:28:08,91 --> 00:28:12,62
-You're avoiding the choice.
-Who is it? Who is it?

472
00:28:16,29 --> 00:28:17,29
It's Tubes.

473
00:28:17,70 --> 00:28:19,91


474
00:28:20,00 --> 00:28:21,83
He's my man.
He tells me everything.

475
00:28:21,91 --> 00:28:24,41
-Tell him. He deserves to know.
-What is this?

476
00:28:27,41 --> 00:28:29,41
What kind of game is this?

477
00:28:30,00 --> 00:28:31,83

-Oh.

478
00:28:35,79 --> 00:28:39,20
There's no way out alive.
Of that you must be sure.

479
00:28:39,83 --> 00:28:42,29
I'm doing this so you'll listen.
So, listen.

480
00:28:46,08 --> 00:28:49,20
Kreegyr goes down,
the ISB will feel invincible.

481
00:28:49,29 --> 00:28:52,50
They'll feel untouchable.
We'll have a clear field to play.

482
00:28:53,45 --> 00:28:56,54
The alternative...
Kreegyr pulls out, we wave him off.

483
00:28:57,41 --> 00:28:59,20
They'll know they'll have to wonder.

484
00:28:59,58 --> 00:29:03,83
They'll trust nothing.
Just like you're doing right now.

485
00:29:06,08 --> 00:29:07,16


486
00:29:07,25 --> 00:29:08,83
If I were ISB, Saw,

487
00:29:08,91 --> 00:29:11,29
why wouldn't I just send you out there
with him?

488
00:29:20,33 --> 00:29:22,41
I didn't want you
to have to make this choice.

489
00:29:26,33 --> 00:29:27,50
Thirty men.

490
00:29:29,12 --> 00:29:30,20
Plus Kreegyr.

491
00:29:37,45 --> 00:29:38,54
For the greater good.

492
00:29:39,33 --> 00:29:40,50
Call it what you will.

493
00:29:44,16 --> 00:29:46,20
Let's call it war.

494
00:29:46,29 --> 00:29:48,37


495
00:30:10,70 --> 00:30:11,70


496
00:30:12,41 --> 00:30:13,70
AUTOMATED VOICE: Safe unlocked.

497
00:30:22,70 --> 00:30:23,79
Safe locked.

498
00:30:24,50 --> 00:30:26,91


499
00:30:28,58 --> 00:30:30,45


500
00:30:38,08 --> 00:30:39,62


501
00:30:39,70 --> 00:30:40,79
KLEYA: Where are you?

502
00:30:41,33 --> 00:30:44,54
-He wanted to reopen the offer.
-KLEYA: And did you close the sale?

503
00:30:44,62 --> 00:30:50,04
I did. It was more expensive than I hoped,
but I wasn't in a position to bargain.

504
00:30:50,12 --> 00:30:51,58
So, you're coming home?

505
00:30:52,62 --> 00:30:53,62
LUTHEN: Depends.

506
00:30:54,70 --> 00:30:56,91
I'm most curious about the other piece.

507
00:30:58,83 --> 00:31:00,04
You should come home.

508
00:31:00,62 --> 00:31:01,87
Is it no longer available?

509
00:31:03,37 --> 00:31:05,58
No, it's very much on the table.

510
00:31:06,12 --> 00:31:09,54
The negotiations are ongoing
and our representatives are involved,

511
00:31:09,62 --> 00:31:11,00
there's other buyers involved,

512
00:31:11,08 --> 00:31:13,50
your presence would complicate
the bidding at this point.

513
00:31:13,58 --> 00:31:16,12
We need that piece. We lose that
and we'll have to close shop.

514
00:31:16,20 --> 00:31:18,83
-There's nothing more you can do.
-That's never true.

515
00:31:20,12 --> 00:31:21,37
It's a crowded market.

516
00:31:21,45 --> 00:31:25,25
You need to think of the consequences
of losing that piece to another collector.

517
00:31:25,66 --> 00:31:27,29
I'm preparing for every outcome.

518
00:31:27,79 --> 00:31:30,12
-LUTHEN: There's only...


519
00:31:30,20 --> 00:31:32,95
Luthen? Luthen?

520
00:31:34,04 --> 00:31:36,37


521
00:31:46,58 --> 00:31:48,95


522
00:31:49,29 --> 00:31:52,29
ELK: 
This is Segra-Milo Imperial patrol.

523
00:31:52,37 --> 00:31:54,37
Please identify yourself, Haulcraft.

524
00:31:56,16 --> 00:31:59,45
LUTHEN: I need an active transponder ID.
Preference, Alderaan.

525
00:31:59,54 --> 00:32:00,58
FONDOR DROID: Working.

526
00:32:01,95 --> 00:32:03,95
Sorry, can you repeat back, please?

527
00:32:04,45 --> 00:32:09,00
This is an Imperial patrol.
Standby for transponder scan.

528
00:32:09,08 --> 00:32:10,12
FONDOR DROID: ID found.

529
00:32:13,37 --> 00:32:16,87
Yes, this is Alderaan 12912505.

530
00:32:16,95 --> 00:32:19,00
Standby, Haulcraft. Run it.

531
00:32:19,66 --> 00:32:21,33


532
00:32:24,04 --> 00:32:25,37
What's out there?

533
00:32:25,45 --> 00:32:29,12
FONDOR DROID: Arrestor cruiser.
Cantwell-class. Three klicks and closing.

534
00:32:30,04 --> 00:32:32,04
LUTHEN: 
Is there something wrong, patrol?

535
00:32:32,12 --> 00:32:34,70
There's been partisan activity
in the area.

536
00:32:34,79 --> 00:32:36,20
This is a piracy zone.

537
00:32:36,29 --> 00:32:39,08
Oh, thank you for the warning.
 I'll be careful.

538
00:32:39,16 --> 00:32:41,87
You'll be standing by
is what you'll be doing.

539
00:32:41,95 --> 00:32:43,04
Power the tractor beam.

540
00:32:43,62 --> 00:32:45,12


541
00:32:45,20 --> 00:32:47,25
-How long on the ID?
-MAN 1: In the queue, sir.

542
00:32:47,70 --> 00:32:48,95


543
00:32:54,12 --> 00:32:56,62
Decoy burn. Port thruster four. Rev it.

544
00:32:57,41 --> 00:32:58,75
FONDOR DROID: Portside thruster four.

545
00:32:59,37 --> 00:33:00,58


546
00:33:00,66 --> 00:33:02,54


547
00:33:02,62 --> 00:33:03,66
ELK: Alderaan Haulcraft,

548
00:33:03,75 --> 00:33:06,87
please disengage any propulsion units
and prepare for tractor beacon.

549
00:33:06,95 --> 00:33:08,45
LUTHEN: Affirmative, patrol.

550
00:33:08,54 --> 00:33:11,79
I have an engine overheating here,
so it may take a moment.

551
00:33:14,20 --> 00:33:17,16

-FONDOR DROID: Countermeasures charging.

552
00:33:17,41 --> 00:33:18,66
Check his thermal.

553
00:33:18,75 --> 00:33:21,20
Aberrant heat signature.
Port-side thruster.

554
00:33:21,29 --> 00:33:23,91
-Get a boarding team ready.
-Prepped and ready, sir.

555
00:33:24,00 --> 00:33:29,37
Tractor beam has been engaged, Haulcraft.
Please, power down your stabilizers.

556
00:33:29,45 --> 00:33:31,58

-Calibrate tractor force.

557
00:33:31,66 --> 00:33:32,70
FONDOR DROID: Calibrating.

558
00:33:37,37 --> 00:33:39,33
Confirm request, Haulcraft.

559
00:33:40,41 --> 00:33:41,83
FONDOR DROID: Tractor force two.

560
00:33:43,12 --> 00:33:47,54
Sorry, patrol. I'm a one man show here.
I have to manual these stabilizers.

561
00:33:47,62 --> 00:33:48,75


562
00:33:48,83 --> 00:33:51,95
ID confirmed, sir.
Alderaan Trade Alliance.

563
00:33:53,25 --> 00:33:54,87
-Cancel the boarding?
-ELK: No.

564
00:33:55,54 --> 00:33:57,04
We can use the practice.

565
00:33:58,25 --> 00:34:01,08
Prepare for boarding
and inspection, Haulcraft.

566
00:34:01,16 --> 00:34:03,66

-Xanwan Freight.
-CASSIAN:  You busy?

594
00:36:04,91 --> 00:36:06,79
 Excuse me? Who is this?

595
00:36:07,20 --> 00:36:09,45
-CASSIAN: Are you alone?
-I'm not getting picture.

596
00:36:10,00 --> 00:36:12,20
CASSIAN: I need to get a message
to Maarva Andor.

597
00:36:13,50 --> 00:36:15,54
-Cassian?
-CASSIAN: Don't. No names.

598
00:36:18,29 --> 00:36:19,37
Where are you?

599
00:36:19,45 --> 00:36:22,87
CASSIAN: Tell Maarva I'm okay.
Tell her I'm thinking about her.

600
00:36:23,54 --> 00:36:24,83
She'd be proud of me.

601
00:36:24,91 --> 00:36:28,16
And I'll get back as soon as I can.
Can you remember that?

602
00:36:29,25 --> 00:36:31,08
-Cass, hang on.
-CASSIAN: No names!

603
00:36:32,54 --> 00:36:35,75
I'm counting on you, Xan.
Just let her know what I said.

604
00:36:35,83 --> 00:36:36,83
Wait.

605
00:36:37,62 --> 00:36:38,66
CASSIAN: What?

606
00:36:38,75 --> 00:36:39,75


607
00:36:42,04 --> 00:36:43,20
Cass, I'm sorry.

608
00:36:46,29 --> 00:36:47,29
Your mother's dead.

609
00:36:49,25 --> 00:36:50,25

You got through? It's okay?

613
00:37:32,08 --> 00:37:34,54
Yeah. Everything okay.

614
00:37:38,45 --> 00:37:39,70
All this space.

615
00:37:41,29 --> 00:37:44,04
Fresh air. Like a dream, right?

616
00:37:46,16 --> 00:37:50,00
How many do you think made it?
How many of us made it out alive?

617
00:37:54,95 --> 00:37:56,00
Not enough.

618
00:37:56,08 --> 00:37:57,54
What if it's just us?

619
00:37:59,45 --> 00:38:00,87
What if we're the only ones?

620
00:38:02,41 --> 00:38:04,95
Somebody's got to tell people
what's happening back there.

621
00:38:07,41 --> 00:38:10,37
We need to split up. Double our chances.

622
00:38:11,29 --> 00:38:15,00
One of us has to make it.
People have to know what's going on.

623
00:38:18,58 --> 00:38:19,58
I know.

624
00:38:21,58 --> 00:38:22,62
Take this.

625
00:38:25,00 --> 00:38:26,58
People have to know about this.
