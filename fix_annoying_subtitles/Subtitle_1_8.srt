1
00:00:04,83 --> 00:00:06,12
They're in.

2
00:00:09,58 --> 00:00:11,54
-<i>We're getting out of here.</i>
-To go where?

3
00:00:11,62 --> 00:00:12,62
Anywhere we want.

4
00:00:13,54 --> 00:00:15,62
I got lucky.

5
00:00:15,70 --> 00:00:18,16
I've got enough credits
to get us anywhere.

6
00:00:18,25 --> 00:00:20,95
We're treating what happened
at Aldhani like a robbery.

7
00:00:21,04 --> 00:00:22,58
What would you call it?

8
00:00:23,79 --> 00:00:25,20
An announcement.

9
00:00:25,29 --> 00:00:27,45
You realize what you've set in motion?

10
00:00:27,54 --> 00:00:29,16
People will suffer.

11
00:00:31,08 --> 00:00:32,37
That's the plan.

12
00:00:32,45 --> 00:00:33,83
<i>I hope she's worth it.</i>

13
00:00:33,91 --> 00:00:35,33
<i>Well, we'll see, won't we?</i>

14
00:00:36,33 --> 00:00:37,87
We can't hide forever.

15
00:00:37,95 --> 00:00:41,12
I can now prove a link between the theft
of our most secret equipment

16
00:00:41,20 --> 00:00:43,62
and its distribution
to rebel groups across the galaxy.

17
00:00:43,70 --> 00:00:47,66
For the moment, I'm reassigning
the Morlana Sector to Supervisor Meero.

18
00:00:47,75 --> 00:00:49,87
Ferrix is of great interest to her

19
00:00:49,95 --> 00:00:52,20
and has clearly
become a distraction for you.

20
00:00:52,29 --> 00:00:55,04
<i>As long as everyone</i>
<i>thinks I'm an irritation,</i>

21
00:00:55,12 --> 00:00:57,29
<i>they might miss what I'm really doing.</i>

22
00:00:57,37 --> 00:00:58,66
What are you really doing?

23
00:00:58,75 --> 00:01:00,00
Raising money.

24
00:01:00,95 --> 00:01:02,29
Raising money for what?

25
00:01:02,37 --> 00:01:03,62
I'm not going.

26
00:01:03,70 --> 00:01:05,16
What are you talking about?

27
00:01:05,25 --> 00:01:08,25
You can't stay, and I can't go.

28
00:01:09,33 --> 00:01:10,58
<i>Morlana One.</i>

29
00:01:10,66 --> 00:01:13,29
I fully intend to clear my name
and have my record expunged.

30
00:01:13,37 --> 00:01:15,29
Why don't we start that process now?

31
00:01:17,41 --> 00:01:19,54
<i>There's a rebel murderer</i>
<i>running free</i>

32
00:01:19,62 --> 00:01:22,00
<i>because of corruption and laxity</i>
<i>in the authority.</i>

33
00:01:22,08 --> 00:01:23,79
Hang onto this one for me.

34
00:01:26,54 --> 00:01:27,75
Six years.

35
00:01:27,83 --> 00:01:28,87
Six years?

36
00:01:29,66 --> 00:01:30,66
No, no, wait!

37
00:01:30,75 --> 00:01:32,45
Change of guidelines.

38
00:01:32,54 --> 00:01:33,95
I didn't do anything!

39
00:01:34,04 --> 00:01:36,12
Wait. I'm just a tourist!

40
00:02:38,29 --> 00:02:39,45
Get in line!

41
00:02:43,25 --> 00:02:44,25
Move it!

42
00:02:46,37 --> 00:02:47,54
Don't you look at me!

43
00:02:49,12 --> 00:02:50,33
Move it!

44
00:02:50,41 --> 00:02:51,54
Keep moving!

45
00:02:51,62 --> 00:02:52,66
Up the stairs!

46
00:02:54,04 --> 00:02:55,16
Pick it up!

47
00:02:59,08 --> 00:03:00,12
Name?

48
00:03:00,20 --> 00:03:01,29
Tuck Hybecks.

49
00:03:01,37 --> 00:03:03,29
-Home planet?
-Galdi.

50
00:03:03,37 --> 00:03:05,33
Belsavis. Next.

51
00:03:07,62 --> 00:03:08,62
Name?

52
00:03:08,70 --> 00:03:10,12
Girgo. Keef Girgo.

53
00:03:10,20 --> 00:03:12,04
-Home planet?
-Deris-plata.

54
00:03:12,12 --> 00:03:13,20
Narkina Five.

55
00:03:13,29 --> 00:03:14,58
What? What's that?

56
00:03:14,66 --> 00:03:15,95
Get to your transport.

57
00:03:16,04 --> 00:03:17,33
-Next.
-What is that?

58
00:03:17,41 --> 00:03:18,66
What's Narkina Five?

59
00:03:18,75 --> 00:03:19,83
I'm a tourist!

60
00:03:19,91 --> 00:03:21,00
Move it.

61
00:03:21,08 --> 00:03:22,79
-Home planet?
-Giermos.

62
00:03:22,87 --> 00:03:24,33
Belsavis.

63
00:03:24,41 --> 00:03:25,45
Right there.

64
00:03:26,04 --> 00:03:27,08
On you go.

65
00:03:28,04 --> 00:03:29,75
Come on, move it, move it.

66
00:04:04,29 --> 00:04:06,08
Anywhere, come on, sit down!

67
00:04:07,79 --> 00:04:08,79
Right, shoes off!

68
00:04:08,87 --> 00:04:11,41
Boots, sandals, everything on the floor!

69
00:04:11,50 --> 00:04:12,50
Toss it in!

70
00:04:12,58 --> 00:04:14,91
Come on, move it, bare feet, let's go!

71
00:04:43,04 --> 00:04:44,54
I'm Lieutenant Dedra Meero.

72
00:04:44,62 --> 00:04:47,33
I'm the ISB Supervisor
for the Morlana Sector.

73
00:04:47,95 --> 00:04:49,41
What happened to Lieutenant Blevin?

74
00:04:49,50 --> 00:04:50,87
I'll ask the questions.

75
00:04:51,54 --> 00:04:53,66
Ferrix. I've been reviewing the incident.

76
00:04:53,75 --> 00:04:56,66
I was planning on calling you in
to fill some gaps in the report.

77
00:04:56,75 --> 00:04:58,20
We were scheduling that.

78
00:04:58,29 --> 00:05:00,37
But now, we've both
had our mornings interrupted

79
00:05:00,45 --> 00:05:03,75
because you keep requesting
the Bureau of Standards Data Center

80
00:05:03,83 --> 00:05:05,54
to look for Cassian Andor.

81
00:05:06,37 --> 00:05:09,62
You've claimed
he was a missing fuel specialist,

82
00:05:09,70 --> 00:05:11,75
an unresponsive energy engineer,

83
00:05:11,83 --> 00:05:16,29
a fuel purity field officer
suspected of forging Imperial reports.

84
00:05:16,37 --> 00:05:20,41
You've been here for less than a month
and you've filed five false inquiries.

85
00:05:20,50 --> 00:05:21,62
Six, actually.

86
00:05:21,70 --> 00:05:23,33
I wasn't counting this morning.

87
00:05:25,37 --> 00:05:27,33
What are you doing, Mr. Karn?

88
00:05:30,50 --> 00:05:33,45
Cassian Andor is a murderer
and a threat to the Empire.

89
00:05:33,54 --> 00:05:36,62
I have been trying, with the limited
tools available, to find him.

90
00:05:36,70 --> 00:05:38,95
So, this is about public safety?

91
00:05:41,66 --> 00:05:43,70
Here's what's happened, Syril.

92
00:05:45,12 --> 00:05:48,33
You have engaged the curiosity of the ISB.

93
00:05:52,58 --> 00:05:54,66
Now, is there anything
you'd care to tell me

94
00:05:54,75 --> 00:05:58,50
before I waste more of my time
figuring out what it is you are up to?

95
00:05:58,58 --> 00:06:00,00
I'm just trying to clear my name.

96
00:06:00,08 --> 00:06:02,79
One would think
you'd want to leave Ferrix far behind.

97
00:06:02,87 --> 00:06:04,91
One would be wrong.

98
00:06:07,58 --> 00:06:08,95
I have a busy day.

99
00:06:09,75 --> 00:06:13,08
Tell me, what's not in Lieutenant Blevin's
report that I need to know?

100
00:06:13,16 --> 00:06:15,91
I have no idea.
I wasn't allowed to see the report.

101
00:06:16,91 --> 00:06:19,50
-You signed it.
-I was given no choice.

102
00:06:28,95 --> 00:06:30,29
We should be upstairs by now.

103
00:06:30,37 --> 00:06:32,20
Give him Blevin's report, let him read it.

104
00:06:32,29 --> 00:06:34,25
-Keep him in there.
-Of all days?

105
00:06:34,33 --> 00:06:35,58
We have time.

106
00:07:29,25 --> 00:07:31,08
This is an Imperial Starpath unit.

107
00:07:31,16 --> 00:07:33,58
It was stolen
from the Steergard Naval yard last year.

108
00:07:33,66 --> 00:07:35,25
We don't know when it was taken

109
00:07:35,33 --> 00:07:37,50
because Steergard
was afraid to disclose its theft

110
00:07:37,58 --> 00:07:39,29
and thought they could hide its absence.

111
00:07:39,37 --> 00:07:42,83
My full report highlights the prevalence
of this problem galaxy-wide.

112
00:07:45,95 --> 00:07:47,16
I'm listening.

113
00:07:49,54 --> 00:07:53,12
This unit was found last month
on Ferrix in the Morlana One Sector.

114
00:07:53,20 --> 00:07:55,95
The thief was a local named Cassian Andor.

115
00:07:56,04 --> 00:07:59,62
He was wanted for the murder
of two Corporate Security officers.

116
00:07:59,70 --> 00:08:04,08
The Starpath was left behind as he escaped
the tactical team sent in to arrest him.

117
00:08:06,37 --> 00:08:11,58
Andor was in the act of transferring
the unit to a person we've named Axis

118
00:08:11,66 --> 00:08:14,12
because of his centrality
to what we believe to be

119
00:08:14,20 --> 00:08:18,04
an organized rebel effort
to acquire specialized Imperial gear.

120
00:08:18,12 --> 00:08:19,95
This is quite the wishlist.

121
00:08:20,04 --> 00:08:23,62
Full planetary comnet,
full Garrison tech package,

122
00:08:23,70 --> 00:08:29,16
Series Nine Spectrum surveillance,
local agent funding, Code Droid.

123
00:08:29,25 --> 00:08:30,83
All ready to go, sir.

124
00:08:30,91 --> 00:08:33,62
If someone there is talking,
we need to be listening.

125
00:08:33,70 --> 00:08:35,04
It's a large investment.

126
00:08:36,00 --> 00:08:38,45
It's a fraction of the price
of lost technology.

127
00:08:42,12 --> 00:08:46,50
So, drill down on Ferrix,
find this thief, and then what?

128
00:08:46,58 --> 00:08:47,75
Identify Axis.

129
00:08:47,83 --> 00:08:49,00
They escaped together.

130
00:08:49,08 --> 00:08:51,04
It's the first best lead we've had.

131
00:08:51,12 --> 00:08:54,29
Supervisor Meero has convinced me

132
00:08:54,37 --> 00:08:56,00
that this Axis has been nimble

133
00:08:56,08 --> 00:08:58,50
in spreading his activities
across the galaxy.

134
00:08:59,25 --> 00:09:04,91
And, no, we don't know who he is,
nor do we know the scope of our problem.

135
00:09:05,00 --> 00:09:10,37
The little we are aware
of is already troubling.

136
00:09:10,45 --> 00:09:12,37
Ferrix was a mistake.

137
00:09:12,45 --> 00:09:14,50
It's the first one he's made.

138
00:09:14,58 --> 00:09:17,58
Drill down is exactly
what I want to do, sir.

139
00:09:17,66 --> 00:09:21,16
Drill down, find Andor,
and get a hunt started.

140
00:09:31,50 --> 00:09:32,70
All right, move!

141
00:09:33,54 --> 00:09:34,54
Go!

142
00:09:34,62 --> 00:09:36,04
Down the ramp!

143
00:09:36,12 --> 00:09:38,08
Down the ramp, now!

144
00:09:39,00 --> 00:09:40,00
Move it!

145
00:09:40,08 --> 00:09:41,75
Stay right there!

146
00:09:41,83 --> 00:09:43,37
On program!

147
00:09:43,45 --> 00:09:45,75
Hands behind heads, feet down!

148
00:10:09,58 --> 00:10:10,87
Breathe deep, brother.

149
00:10:10,95 --> 00:10:13,54
This may be the last fresh air
we ever taste.

150
00:10:16,54 --> 00:10:18,58
Welcome to Narkina Five.

151
00:10:20,16 --> 00:10:22,66
This is an Imperial factory facility.

152
00:10:22,75 --> 00:10:25,45
You've all been assessed as labor-worthy.

153
00:10:25,54 --> 00:10:27,45
Now, following this introduction,

154
00:10:27,54 --> 00:10:30,25
you'll be transferred
to your level assignment and workroom,

155
00:10:30,33 --> 00:10:33,25
where your floor manager
will explain the details

156
00:10:33,33 --> 00:10:35,95
of our schedule and expectations.

157
00:10:36,91 --> 00:10:39,45
Your length of stay
has been predetermined.

158
00:10:39,54 --> 00:10:42,66
The quality of that time
will be up to you.

159
00:10:43,29 --> 00:10:46,87
Now, those who've been incarcerated
before will be surprised by the calm,

160
00:10:46,95 --> 00:10:52,20
sanitary conditions, and our minimally
invasive enforcement techniques.

161
00:10:54,25 --> 00:10:56,62
Well, I'm sure some,
if not all of you, are wondering,

162
00:10:56,70 --> 00:11:00,12
how we risk standing
before you without weapons?

163
00:11:00,20 --> 00:11:01,70
It's a potent question.

164
00:11:02,79 --> 00:11:06,58
And hopefully, one you won't need
to have answered very often, but...

165
00:11:21,04 --> 00:11:22,41
You may stand.

166
00:11:23,00 --> 00:11:25,45
That was level one of three.

167
00:11:25,54 --> 00:11:28,12
Our floors are Tunqstoid steel.

168
00:11:28,79 --> 00:11:31,33
Do your time productively,
keep to your lane,

169
00:11:31,41 --> 00:11:33,50
and this needn't be more than a memory.

170
00:11:34,29 --> 00:11:35,54
Good luck to you.

171
00:11:37,62 --> 00:11:38,62
Up!

172
00:11:39,87 --> 00:11:42,20
Line up! Single file!

173
00:11:43,00 --> 00:11:44,00
Up!

174
00:11:45,37 --> 00:11:46,45
Let's go!

175
00:11:52,75 --> 00:11:54,00
You've read the report?

176
00:11:55,95 --> 00:11:57,12
Worse than I feared.

177
00:11:57,70 --> 00:11:59,87
Criminal negligence
of my commanding officer,

178
00:11:59,95 --> 00:12:02,37
the total lack
of Imperial authority on Ferrix,

179
00:12:02,45 --> 00:12:05,91
the fact that Andor obviously had
an organized local cadre of accomplices.

180
00:12:06,75 --> 00:12:07,83
None of that is here.

181
00:12:07,91 --> 00:12:10,58
Let's talk about
the accomplice you encountered.

182
00:12:10,66 --> 00:12:14,04
You told Lieutenant Blevin that Andor was
in the company of an older man,

183
00:12:14,12 --> 00:12:15,62
tall, wearing a cloak.

184
00:12:15,70 --> 00:12:17,12
What's not in here?

185
00:12:19,75 --> 00:12:20,75
Uh...

186
00:12:21,70 --> 00:12:23,87
Grey cloak, grey green.

187
00:12:24,16 --> 00:12:26,54
Dark boots.

188
00:12:27,95 --> 00:12:29,12
I didn't get a good look.

189
00:12:30,70 --> 00:12:31,70
Uh...

190
00:12:32,37 --> 00:12:34,04
I heard his voice, I'd recognize it.

191
00:12:34,12 --> 00:12:36,37
Here's what we'll do, Mr. Karn.

192
00:12:36,45 --> 00:12:39,08
You'll stop filing requests for Andor.

193
00:12:39,16 --> 00:12:42,25
Anticipating that,
I will inform the Bureau of Standards

194
00:12:42,33 --> 00:12:44,87
that you were of service
to the Empire today.

195
00:12:47,41 --> 00:12:49,58
I was a good deputy inspector!

196
00:12:53,87 --> 00:12:55,08
I was very good.

197
00:12:55,16 --> 00:12:57,75
I solved a double murder
and found the killer in two days.

198
00:12:57,83 --> 00:12:59,20
I was overly ambitious, yes,

199
00:12:59,29 --> 00:13:01,95
but time was slipping away,
and the opportunity was real.

200
00:13:04,04 --> 00:13:07,29
Service to the Empire, you just said it.

201
00:13:08,66 --> 00:13:11,20
Can one ever be too aggressive
in preserving order?

202
00:13:13,16 --> 00:13:14,75
I didn't deserve what happened.

203
00:13:15,70 --> 00:13:17,08
I wish you luck.

204
00:13:17,16 --> 00:13:18,16
I'm running late.

205
00:13:19,00 --> 00:13:21,70
It's clear you need Andor
in order to find his partner.

206
00:13:23,45 --> 00:13:27,58
This is more important than the death
of two Corporate Security guards.

207
00:13:27,66 --> 00:13:30,04
I could be a valuable asset going forward.

208
00:13:34,20 --> 00:13:39,50
Raise the alarm one more time,
and it won't be me you're speaking to.

209
00:13:42,87 --> 00:13:44,04
Forget this happened.

210
00:14:12,58 --> 00:14:13,58
Stop right there.

211
00:14:14,50 --> 00:14:15,50
On program.

212
00:14:15,58 --> 00:14:19,00
That means, hands on head,
eyes front, feet on the floor.

213
00:14:19,08 --> 00:14:20,08
Do it.

214
00:14:25,20 --> 00:14:26,25
Zap rod.

215
00:14:26,33 --> 00:14:28,16
If I have to use it, you'll remember it.

216
00:14:28,25 --> 00:14:29,91
Yes? Yes?

217
00:14:31,33 --> 00:14:33,08
What's goin' on? Where's your partner?

218
00:14:33,16 --> 00:14:34,62
They had a tech problem on One.

219
00:14:34,70 --> 00:14:36,83
Delivery takes priority
over tech, you know that.

220
00:14:36,91 --> 00:14:38,37
He'll be here any second.

221
00:14:38,45 --> 00:14:41,66
New man ready on five-two-D,
requesting units override.

222
00:14:41,75 --> 00:14:43,08
<i>Copy that. Coming up.</i>

223
00:14:43,16 --> 00:14:44,91
That's not good.
This was on the schedule.

224
00:14:45,00 --> 00:14:47,37
-He can't just not turn up.
-He'll be here.

225
00:14:47,45 --> 00:14:49,79
<i>Override engaged.</i>
<i>Five-two, you have the floor.</i>

226
00:14:49,87 --> 00:14:51,37
We've got deliveries' waiting.

227
00:14:51,45 --> 00:14:53,91
-Eyes front.
-Let's just get him out on the Ring.

228
00:14:54,00 --> 00:14:55,33
Step forward, let's go, move.

229
00:14:55,41 --> 00:14:57,66
Step forward and stop, now, move.

230
00:14:57,75 --> 00:14:59,04
Stop.

231
00:14:59,12 --> 00:15:00,12
Eyes front, I said.

232
00:15:00,20 --> 00:15:01,62
Sorry, I had to wait.

233
00:15:01,70 --> 00:15:03,04
They were short-handed.

234
00:15:03,12 --> 00:15:06,08
They had to pull a guy out from Four.
I came as quick as I could.

235
00:15:06,16 --> 00:15:07,70
Post up. We're already behind.

236
00:15:08,37 --> 00:15:10,12
-We good?
-Yes, you can go.

237
00:15:11,66 --> 00:15:13,62
-Ready on the floor?
-Looks good.

238
00:15:13,70 --> 00:15:14,91
Prep for door.

239
00:15:20,70 --> 00:15:22,20
<i>On program.</i>

240
00:15:23,54 --> 00:15:25,20
Step on to the lift and stop.

241
00:15:25,75 --> 00:15:27,75
-Move forward.
-New man on the floor!

242
00:15:28,41 --> 00:15:30,25
-Move.
-Hold your positions.

243
00:15:30,33 --> 00:15:31,83
Step on there and stop.

244
00:15:57,79 --> 00:15:58,79
Step off, move.

245
00:16:00,00 --> 00:16:01,33
I said, step off, now!

246
00:16:01,41 --> 00:16:02,45
Move!

247
00:16:06,29 --> 00:16:09,20
This is Unit Five-Two-D.

248
00:16:10,00 --> 00:16:13,70
Level five, room two,
the D is for Day shift.

249
00:16:13,79 --> 00:16:16,91
Seven levels of factory,
seven rooms per level,

250
00:16:17,00 --> 00:16:21,33
seven tables per room,
seven men, each table.

251
00:16:22,25 --> 00:16:24,20
My name is Kino Loy.

252
00:16:24,29 --> 00:16:26,08
I'm the Five-Two-D unit manager.

253
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:29,54
The forty-nine men
in this room answer to me.

254
00:16:29,62 --> 00:16:30,83
Name.

255
00:16:30,91 --> 00:16:31,91
Keef.

256
00:16:33,08 --> 00:16:34,45
Keef Girgo.

257
00:16:35,04 --> 00:16:36,08
He won't be back.

258
00:16:36,83 --> 00:16:40,29
They only come to pick up the dead
and bring their replacements.

259
00:16:40,37 --> 00:16:41,50
You're mine now.

260
00:16:42,75 --> 00:16:44,58
Off program!

261
00:16:44,66 --> 00:16:46,04
Back to work!

262
00:16:46,83 --> 00:16:47,83
Listen up.

263
00:16:48,87 --> 00:16:50,70
It's a 12-hour shift.

264
00:16:51,33 --> 00:16:56,79
Productivity is encouraged,
evaluation is constant.

265
00:16:58,37 --> 00:17:00,91
You have been assigned table five,

266
00:17:01,54 --> 00:17:03,12
which is the pod that is behind

267
00:17:03,20 --> 00:17:05,75
because you're not on the line
doing your job.

268
00:17:05,83 --> 00:17:07,45
-Can you read?
-Yeah.

269
00:17:07,54 --> 00:17:09,79
You see in the main boxes,
one through seven,

270
00:17:09,87 --> 00:17:13,04
those are the scores for the tables
in this room, on this shift.

271
00:17:13,12 --> 00:17:14,41
What's your table number?

272
00:17:15,29 --> 00:17:16,29
Five.

273
00:17:17,04 --> 00:17:18,41
There you go, table five.

274
00:17:18,50 --> 00:17:19,70
See it? At the bottom?

275
00:17:19,79 --> 00:17:21,54
Last place. That's you.

276
00:17:22,20 --> 00:17:24,12
The seven tallies are the running shift

277
00:17:24,20 --> 00:17:27,08
totals of all the other rooms
on this floor.

278
00:17:27,16 --> 00:17:30,33
You play against
all the other tables in this room,

279
00:17:30,41 --> 00:17:33,29
I play against all the other rooms.

280
00:17:33,37 --> 00:17:35,25
-Play?
-Call it what you will,

281
00:17:35,33 --> 00:17:39,79
the point of this conversation is that
you understand one thing most clearly.

282
00:17:40,45 --> 00:17:44,45
I have 249 days left of my sentence.

283
00:17:44,54 --> 00:17:47,79
I have a free hand in how I run this room.

284
00:17:47,87 --> 00:17:50,25
I'm used to being
in the top three on the level.

285
00:17:50,33 --> 00:17:52,79
You will wanna keep that happening.

286
00:17:52,87 --> 00:17:54,50
I'm sensing you understand me.

287
00:17:54,58 --> 00:17:56,87
Sick, injured, you talk to me.

288
00:17:56,95 --> 00:18:00,00
Problems with another inmate,
I'll know before you do.

289
00:18:00,83 --> 00:18:04,87
Losing hope, your mind,
keep it to yourself.

290
00:18:04,95 --> 00:18:08,45
Don't ever slow up my line.

291
00:18:09,16 --> 00:18:10,20
Table five.

292
00:18:13,08 --> 00:18:14,08
Table five!

293
00:18:19,20 --> 00:18:20,20
Table five?

294
00:18:20,29 --> 00:18:22,41
Yeah, we've been waiting.
What do we call you?

295
00:18:22,50 --> 00:18:23,66
Keef.

296
00:18:23,75 --> 00:18:25,54
I'm Jemboc. Welcome.

297
00:18:26,20 --> 00:18:27,20
Xaul.

298
00:18:27,91 --> 00:18:29,16
Taga.

299
00:18:29,25 --> 00:18:30,25
Ulaf.

300
00:18:31,41 --> 00:18:32,54
Ham.

301
00:18:32,62 --> 00:18:34,25
And this is Melshi.

302
00:18:34,33 --> 00:18:35,37
We're down ten.

303
00:18:35,91 --> 00:18:38,29
-We're a man short, he'll give us a pass.
-He should.

304
00:18:38,37 --> 00:18:39,83
-He won't.
-He's done it before.

305
00:18:39,91 --> 00:18:42,70
-That was months ago.
-We're down ten. You're dreaming.

306
00:18:42,79 --> 00:18:44,54
-He's done it before.
-We're wasting time.

307
00:18:44,62 --> 00:18:46,29
Down 12 before you know it.

308
00:18:46,37 --> 00:18:49,08
They give us a new man
with only an hour left?

309
00:18:49,16 --> 00:18:52,20
Forty-two minutes,
come on, boys, we can rally.

310
00:18:52,29 --> 00:18:54,45
-They're up there, laughing.
-Don't.

311
00:18:54,54 --> 00:18:56,58
-Melshi's right.
-We're wasting time.

312
00:18:56,66 --> 00:18:58,16
Jem thinks Kino's in charge.

313
00:18:58,25 --> 00:19:00,62
Hey, new guy, prepare to fry.

314
00:19:00,70 --> 00:19:02,66
-Keef.
-What?

315
00:19:02,75 --> 00:19:04,29
It's his name. Right?

316
00:19:04,95 --> 00:19:06,25
Keef.

317
00:19:06,95 --> 00:19:08,66
Work!

318
00:19:08,75 --> 00:19:10,58
-Ham's right, get to it.
-Fly.

319
00:19:11,20 --> 00:19:12,20
Stand back.

320
00:19:12,29 --> 00:19:14,29
Watch what I do, exactly what I do.

321
00:19:14,37 --> 00:19:16,08
You'll be where I am this time tomorrow.

322
00:19:16,16 --> 00:19:17,79
With seven men, I'm the Swing,

323
00:19:17,87 --> 00:19:20,54
I'll be feeding the table
so it might be a little different...

324
00:19:20,62 --> 00:19:22,33
-He's on the box.
-They're callin' him.

325
00:19:23,37 --> 00:19:24,37
No.

326
00:19:27,08 --> 00:19:30,41
<i>Five-Two-D shift</i>
<i>productivity levels are unacceptable.</i>

327
00:19:30,50 --> 00:19:31,91
<i>We're calling a new clock.</i>

328
00:19:32,00 --> 00:19:33,12
Okay, listen up!

329
00:19:33,95 --> 00:19:36,95
This will be a sprint segment.

330
00:19:37,04 --> 00:19:39,37
39 minutes on the tone.

331
00:19:39,45 --> 00:19:43,29
<i>As ever, the least</i>
<i>productive table will be disciplined.</i>

332
00:19:48,33 --> 00:19:49,70
-Hands away.
-Clear.

333
00:19:55,58 --> 00:19:56,62
Come on, boys.

334
00:19:57,41 --> 00:19:59,37
Let's go, let's go.

335
00:20:06,87 --> 00:20:08,20
Come on, come on, come on.

336
00:20:09,50 --> 00:20:11,12
Get busy, or get fried!

337
00:20:23,33 --> 00:20:24,95
Keep it going!

338
00:20:43,70 --> 00:20:44,70
Not for me.

339
00:20:44,79 --> 00:20:45,83
I'll have hers.

340
00:20:48,20 --> 00:20:49,29
You used to like it.

341
00:20:50,29 --> 00:20:51,70
I was just better at pretending.

342
00:20:51,79 --> 00:20:53,16
Well, that I find hard to believe.

00:20:54,33 --> 00:20:56,58
-What are we toasting?
-A quick night.

345
00:20:56,91 --> 00:20:58,62
-Hmm. I'll drink to that.

346
00:21:00,00 --> 00:21:01,75
So, the evening's agenda?

347
00:21:01,83 --> 00:21:04,75
I need votes to stall
the Emperor's latest overreach.

348
00:21:06,29 --> 00:21:07,41
Hello, Tay.

349
00:21:08,29 --> 00:21:10,41
Tay Kolma, how prompt you are.

350
00:21:10,50 --> 00:21:11,54
Perrin.

351
00:21:11,62 --> 00:21:13,04
Still in town, or commuting?

352
00:21:13,12 --> 00:21:14,87
-Bit of both.
-Something to drink?

353
00:21:14,95 --> 00:21:16,33
What are we having?

354
00:21:16,79 --> 00:21:18,45
Taste of home, eh? I'll have one.

355
00:21:18,54 --> 00:21:19,62
Make it three.

356
00:21:19,70 --> 00:21:21,04
I'm fine, thank you.

357
00:21:21,12 --> 00:21:23,41
-Mon is working.
-Well, there's much to be done.

358
00:21:23,50 --> 00:21:25,54
I don't think
you're on the menu tonight, Tay.

359
00:21:25,62 --> 00:21:27,95
The Senator is pitching politics,
not charity.

360
00:21:28,04 --> 00:21:30,62
-Saving the Empire from the Emperor.

361
00:21:30,70 --> 00:21:32,12
Do you remember Perrin at 15?

362
00:21:32,20 --> 00:21:33,20
Oh, let's not.

363
00:21:33,29 --> 00:21:34,87
The academy firebrand.

364
00:21:34,95 --> 00:21:36,58
-Two squigs again, sir?
-Please.

365
00:21:36,66 --> 00:21:37,87
How things change, eh?

366
00:21:39,25 --> 00:21:43,12
The new legislation
is definitely having an effect.

367
00:21:43,20 --> 00:21:46,50
The rebels might have thought that over
before blowing up Aldhani.

368
00:21:47,37 --> 00:21:48,37
Thank you.

369
00:21:48,45 --> 00:21:49,45
<i>Sagrona.</i>

370

00:21:56,00 --> 00:21:57,29
Charity begins at home.

373
00:21:58,79 --> 00:22:00,04
I was hoping you'd come.

374
00:22:00,12 --> 00:22:01,54
I wish I had better news.

375
00:22:01,62 --> 00:22:03,16
I'm about to get very busy.

376
00:22:03,25 --> 00:22:05,70
The new banking regulations
are making life difficult.

377
00:22:05,79 --> 00:22:07,87
-Difficult or impossible?
-I don't know.

378
00:22:07,95 --> 00:22:11,37
They're staffing up Imperial auditors,
we'll see where they are placed.

379
00:22:11,45 --> 00:22:13,08
Is there anything we can do?

380
00:22:13,16 --> 00:22:14,50
That has its own risks.

381
00:22:15,08 --> 00:22:16,08
Leida.

382
00:22:16,16 --> 00:22:18,04
-Uh, we've met.
-Indeed.

383
00:22:19,16 --> 00:22:20,62
You're here all the time now.

384
00:22:20,70 --> 00:22:21,95
Learning to love Coruscant.

385
00:22:23,25 --> 00:22:24,87
Your father's looking for you.

386
00:22:24,95 --> 00:22:26,25
You're drinking squigs?

387
00:22:26,33 --> 00:22:27,91
No, I've lost my taste for it.

388
00:22:28,00 --> 00:22:29,00
It's disgusting.

389
00:22:29,08 --> 00:22:30,12
That's the point.

390
00:22:32,20 --> 00:22:33,41
I should find Dad.

391
00:22:33,50 --> 00:22:34,75
Nice to see you again.

392
00:22:36,45 --> 00:22:38,66
What about the money I've moved already?

393
00:22:38,75 --> 00:22:40,16
Not everything's tucked away.

394
00:22:40,25 --> 00:22:41,79
We'll find a way to explain it.

395
00:22:41,87 --> 00:22:43,33
So, we've given up on hiding it?

396
00:22:43,41 --> 00:22:45,08
How much are we worrying about?

397
00:22:45,16 --> 00:22:46,45
Four hundred thousand.

398
00:22:47,95 --> 00:22:49,08
Senator.

399
00:22:49,16 --> 00:22:51,70
Hi! I was just coming to get you.

400
00:22:51,79 --> 00:22:53,62
Perrin said you were hoarding the squigs.

401
00:22:53,70 --> 00:22:56,00
I always forget
you're Chandrilan at heart.

402
00:22:56,08 --> 00:22:59,45
And I always forget how sweet you are
when you're looking for votes.

403
00:23:27,95 --> 00:23:29,20
Keep it down!

404
00:23:33,16 --> 00:23:36,41
Keep it down!

405
00:24:12,45 --> 00:24:13,50
Line up!

406
00:24:14,20 --> 00:24:15,20
Let's go!

407
00:24:22,91 --> 00:24:25,45
Palpatine's frustrating,
yes, we agree.

408
00:24:25,54 --> 00:24:26,87
Too easily provoked? Yes.

409
00:24:26,95 --> 00:24:29,00
Overreactive, but...

410
00:24:29,08 --> 00:24:30,12
Understatement.

411
00:24:30,20 --> 00:24:31,29
Says what he means.

412
00:24:31,37 --> 00:24:34,54
We're discussing legislation,
not speeches.

413
00:24:34,62 --> 00:24:35,75
What does he mean?

414
00:24:35,83 --> 00:24:37,00
What is public order?

415
00:24:37,08 --> 00:24:38,75
It's an awfully big box, isn't it?

416
00:24:38,83 --> 00:24:42,37
The Emperor's primary charge
is to protect us, is it not?

417
00:24:42,45 --> 00:24:45,12
And that's what the P.O.R.D.
legislation will do.

418
00:24:45,20 --> 00:24:47,08
How much protection is enough?

419
00:24:47,16 --> 00:24:49,00
We know what too little looks like.

420
00:24:49,08 --> 00:24:51,87
Surveillance and prosecution
without limit.

421
00:24:51,95 --> 00:24:54,29
If you're doing nothing wrong,
what is there to fear?

422
00:24:54,37 --> 00:24:56,33
I'm fearing your definition of wrong.

423
00:24:56,41 --> 00:24:57,87
These are dangerous times.

424
00:24:57,95 --> 00:25:00,12
-Dangerous times?
-Are they not?

425
00:25:00,20 --> 00:25:01,41
Do you feel under threat?

426
00:25:01,50 --> 00:25:03,91
Personally? Here, yes.

427
00:25:04,00 --> 00:25:08,33
I'm at great risk of ingesting too much
of this nourishing Chandrilan hospitality.

428
00:25:23,75 --> 00:25:24,95
This is our block.

429
00:25:26,00 --> 00:25:28,04
You see the white lights?
That's the floor.

430
00:25:28,12 --> 00:25:29,83
White is cold, red is hot.

431
00:25:29,91 --> 00:25:33,66
The white lights start flashing,
you got seven seconds to get to your cell.

432
00:25:34,75 --> 00:25:38,25
Sensors in the floor, two men in one cell,
it's an instant fry.

433
00:25:38,83 --> 00:25:40,12
Fall out!

434
00:25:40,20 --> 00:25:41,54
Fall out, fall out, fall out.

435
00:25:42,16 --> 00:25:44,83
-Jem, walk the new man.
-Yeah.

436
00:25:44,91 --> 00:25:46,08
Okay, Kino.

437
00:25:47,04 --> 00:25:48,04
Come on.

438
00:25:50,33 --> 00:25:51,37
This is you.

439
00:25:52,75 --> 00:25:53,83
Your rack.

440
00:25:53,91 --> 00:25:56,33
Everything you need here is on the wall.

441
00:25:56,41 --> 00:26:02,79
Water, night light, toilet flips down,
got a plate, spoon, and shaver.

442
00:26:02,87 --> 00:26:04,16
-And food?

443
00:26:05,08 --> 00:26:06,08
The tube.

444
00:26:07,08 --> 00:26:08,54
You can get as much as you want.

445
00:26:09,12 --> 00:26:11,08
They like us healthy and fueled.

446
00:26:11,16 --> 00:26:14,16
Don't worry, you'll learn to eat it.

447
00:26:15,29 --> 00:26:18,25
Tough way to start,
getting fried twice in one day.

448
00:26:19,41 --> 00:26:23,45
But perhaps in a few shifts,
we can pull a winner.

449
00:26:24,41 --> 00:26:26,70
Winner gets taste with their food.

450
00:26:27,50 --> 00:26:29,20
Top table wins flavor.

451
00:26:29,29 --> 00:26:31,50
Last place gets fried.

452
00:26:33,54 --> 00:26:38,58
Right, this will be cleaned every day,
and that is your tab.

453
00:26:41,00 --> 00:26:42,00
What did you do?

454
00:26:45,25 --> 00:26:46,37
Nothing.

455
00:26:46,45 --> 00:26:47,50
Lot of that lately.

456
00:26:48,20 --> 00:26:51,70
At least you know where you stand
from the start, no surprises.

457
00:26:51,79 --> 00:26:53,50
Ask him already.

458
00:26:54,25 --> 00:26:56,45
They doubled everyone's number last month.

459
00:26:57,25 --> 00:26:58,58
P-O-R-D.

460
00:26:58,66 --> 00:27:01,29
-People must be talkin' about it.
-About what?

461
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:03,79
The Public Order
Resentencing Directive.

462
00:27:03,87 --> 00:27:06,16
It's been a tough month here
waiting for news.

463
00:27:06,25 --> 00:27:08,20
Can't help but wonder
what people are saying.

464
00:27:11,75 --> 00:27:12,91
He's never heard of it.

465
00:27:14,00 --> 00:27:15,58
-He never heard of it.
-Told you.

466
00:27:15,66 --> 00:27:18,62
The Public Order Decree.

467
00:27:18,70 --> 00:27:19,95
The resentencings.

468
00:27:20,04 --> 00:27:22,58
-I'm sorry.
-All the rebel activity.

469
00:27:22,66 --> 00:27:25,04
-It's rebel nonsense.
-I don't know anything about it.

470
00:27:25,12 --> 00:27:27,95
-They slaughtered a garrison.
-That's not what he said.

471
00:27:28,04 --> 00:27:29,87
-They burned it down.
-Does it matter?

472
00:27:29,95 --> 00:27:31,75
We're the ones getting punished.

473
00:27:31,83 --> 00:27:33,20
But this guy never heard of it.

474
00:27:34,45 --> 00:27:35,79
Don't ever look at the number.

475
00:27:35,87 --> 00:27:37,70
-Double, triple, it doesn't matter.
-Hey!

476
00:27:37,79 --> 00:27:39,95
You're here 'til they don't want you.
Understand?

477
00:27:40,04 --> 00:27:41,20
Enough! Melshi!

478
00:27:41,29 --> 00:27:43,08
Getting out now is just a dream.

479
00:27:43,16 --> 00:27:44,87
Those days are over.

480
00:27:46,83 --> 00:27:48,37
I said, that's enough.

481
00:27:49,91 --> 00:27:52,29
<i>Return to</i>
<i>your cells immediately.</i>

482
00:27:52,37 --> 00:27:54,45
<i>Thirty seconds on red floor.</i>

483
00:28:00,58 --> 00:28:02,16
You don't walk in your sleep, do you?

484
00:28:03,16 --> 00:28:04,37
What?

485
00:28:05,00 --> 00:28:06,29
You'll find out.

486
00:28:06,37 --> 00:28:07,37
Tighten up!

487
00:28:08,04 --> 00:28:09,16
Hot floor!

488
00:29:00,20 --> 00:29:02,91
Oh, you should ask my wife.
I never look out the window.

489
00:29:03,00 --> 00:29:04,91
-Ah! Here she is.

490
00:29:05,00 --> 00:29:06,00
Your embassy hostess.

491
00:29:06,08 --> 00:29:07,29
The question was,

492
00:29:07,37 --> 00:29:10,50
how many hours a day
do we stand here admiring the view?

493
00:29:10,58 --> 00:29:13,29
We should. I know.

494
00:29:13,37 --> 00:29:14,95
-Not enough!

495
00:29:15,04 --> 00:29:16,16
I think I'd never leave.

496
00:29:16,25 --> 00:29:17,91
Well, that's always the way, isn't it?

497
00:29:18,00 --> 00:29:19,75
One forgets to savor the familiar.

498
00:29:19,83 --> 00:29:20,83
So true.

499
00:29:20,91 --> 00:29:22,25
We came here as children.

500
00:29:22,33 --> 00:29:25,66
-To visit?
-No, Mon became a Senator at 16.

501
00:29:25,75 --> 00:29:26,91
So this is where you met?

502
00:29:27,00 --> 00:29:29,29
No, we'd already been married a year.

503
00:29:29,37 --> 00:29:30,83
That's so romantic.

504
00:29:30,91 --> 00:29:31,91
And traditional.

505
00:29:32,58 --> 00:29:33,87
The old ways of Chandrila.

506
00:29:33,95 --> 00:29:35,33
As was the custom.

507
00:29:35,41 --> 00:29:36,75
To each people its own.

508
00:29:37,83 --> 00:29:39,87
Speaking of, have you seen Tay?

509
00:29:40,54 --> 00:29:41,66
No, he left.

510
00:29:41,75 --> 00:29:43,41
He said he had an early morning.

511
00:29:43,50 --> 00:29:44,54
Well, of course.

512
00:29:45,33 --> 00:29:46,66
Excuse me if you will.

513
00:29:46,75 --> 00:29:48,00
So nice to meet you.

514
00:29:48,08 --> 00:29:51,08
I'm going to spend more time
at this window, I promise you.

515
00:30:34,41 --> 00:30:35,45
Tighten up!

516
00:31:23,45 --> 00:31:24,45
Flight.

517
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:30,16
Three's off two, they're at 18.

518
00:31:30,83 --> 00:31:32,20
Four is struggling.

519
00:31:33,16 --> 00:31:34,16
Flight.

520
00:31:34,25 --> 00:31:35,25
Hands away.

521
00:31:35,33 --> 00:31:36,70
-Clear.
-Clear.

522
00:31:39,20 --> 00:31:40,29
Away!

523
00:31:41,12 --> 00:31:42,41
-Flight!
-Clear!

524
00:31:45,37 --> 00:31:47,54
All right, come on, come on, come on.

525
00:31:50,62 --> 00:31:51,62
Ready?

526
00:31:52,87 --> 00:31:54,41
-I think so.
-It's tight.

527
00:31:54,50 --> 00:31:55,50
Flip it.

528
00:32:04,58 --> 00:32:05,83
-Ready up?
-Ready up.

529
00:32:05,91 --> 00:32:07,25
Well, hang on, hang on.

530
00:32:07,33 --> 00:32:09,25
-You okay?
-Pin jam.

531
00:32:09,33 --> 00:32:10,91
Xaul, help him.

532
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:12,00
Yeah. Come on, mate.

533
00:32:18,20 --> 00:32:19,37
Hey!

534
00:32:20,70 --> 00:32:22,75
You just takin' a breather?

535
00:32:23,41 --> 00:32:24,45
Come on, guys!

536
00:32:24,54 --> 00:32:26,50
You got a chance of winning
the shift today!

537
00:32:27,54 --> 00:32:28,83
Be a shame to waste it.

538
00:32:29,58 --> 00:32:30,79
Keef.

539
00:32:31,75 --> 00:32:32,91
Keef!

540
00:32:36,75 --> 00:32:38,41
-Yeah.
-Yes!

541
00:32:38,50 --> 00:32:39,62
Drill in!

542
00:33:01,33 --> 00:33:04,33
It's not complaining
if you tell me what's going on.

543
00:33:04,41 --> 00:33:06,41
Oh, you're freezing!

544
00:33:07,12 --> 00:33:09,83
My mother was a whiner
and that'll cure you.

545
00:33:12,08 --> 00:33:14,75
I'm just trying to figure out
if you need a doctor or not.

546
00:33:14,83 --> 00:33:16,79
She has p-p-pain in the knee.

547
00:33:16,87 --> 00:33:18,62
The doctor was here yesterday.

548
00:33:20,37 --> 00:33:21,87
Your breathing sounds weak.

549
00:33:22,87 --> 00:33:24,25
You got dizzy again.

550
00:33:25,33 --> 00:33:26,79
What have you done now?

551
00:33:27,58 --> 00:33:29,37
Apparently I'm throwing a party.

552
00:33:29,45 --> 00:33:31,66
I heard the boys
had to carry you back here.

553
00:33:31,75 --> 00:33:33,37
Oh! Word travels fast.

554
00:33:33,45 --> 00:33:34,45
She fell.

555
00:33:42,41 --> 00:33:44,16
<i>What was she doing by the hotel?</i>

556
00:33:44,83 --> 00:33:46,45
She's obsessed with Troopers.

557
00:33:47,29 --> 00:33:49,62
She fell trying to pry open
the old Rix flood gate.

558
00:33:50,58 --> 00:33:52,54
-She gonna flush them out?
-No.

559
00:33:53,41 --> 00:33:56,29
She wanted to see if the tunnel
under the hotel was still open.

560
00:33:57,41 --> 00:33:58,41
Why?

561
00:33:59,08 --> 00:34:01,83
So the Rebellion can sneak in
and take them by surprise.

562
00:34:03,95 --> 00:34:04,95
She's a Rebel.

563
00:34:08,75 --> 00:34:10,37
I should be coming by more often.

564
00:34:10,45 --> 00:34:11,87
She's not your mother.

565
00:34:11,95 --> 00:34:13,04
Or yours.

566
00:34:15,33 --> 00:34:18,20
-She can't stay here much longer.
-Good luck with that.

567
00:34:18,29 --> 00:34:19,95
What about the Daughters of Ferrix?

568
00:34:20,04 --> 00:34:21,41
She's a past president.

569
00:34:21,50 --> 00:34:23,12
They must have a warm room somewhere.

570
00:34:23,20 --> 00:34:24,20
They've tried.

571
00:34:24,29 --> 00:34:25,79
She's made her wishes clear.

572
00:34:29,37 --> 00:34:30,37
Cassian.

573
00:34:31,62 --> 00:34:33,12
You really don't know where he is?

574
00:34:49,08 --> 00:34:50,37
Where did you go?

575
00:34:50,45 --> 00:34:51,54
Who's the big one?

576
00:34:52,37 --> 00:34:53,41
I've no idea.

577
00:34:54,54 --> 00:34:56,75
Where were you?
I was about to come lookin'.

578
00:34:57,70 --> 00:34:58,83
Cold now.

579
00:35:02,95 --> 00:35:03,95
What?

580
00:35:05,08 --> 00:35:07,08
There's a room to rent around the corner.

581
00:35:07,16 --> 00:35:08,66
They have a sign up.

582
00:35:08,75 --> 00:35:10,12
Can't just stay here.

583
00:35:10,20 --> 00:35:11,20
I can.

584
00:35:12,08 --> 00:35:13,08
Alone?

585
00:35:14,33 --> 00:35:16,25
Two of us would draw too much attention.

586
00:35:16,33 --> 00:35:17,62
You'll stay here and wait?

587
00:35:17,70 --> 00:35:19,83
Just hope he shows up?

588
00:35:19,91 --> 00:35:21,70
-Could be anywhere.
-This is all we have.

589
00:35:21,79 --> 00:35:22,87
What's the alternative?

590
00:35:24,29 --> 00:35:26,25
Haven't we been apart long enough?

591
00:35:26,33 --> 00:35:27,87
It's not about us.

592
00:35:29,33 --> 00:35:30,91
After what we've been through?

593
00:35:32,95 --> 00:35:35,33
You think the Empire
stops to catch its breath?

594
00:35:36,83 --> 00:35:38,66
This is a fight to the death, Vel.

595
00:35:42,16 --> 00:35:43,54
Who would you say you are?

596
00:35:46,12 --> 00:35:49,08
Maybe I'm a rich girl
running away from her family.

597
00:35:50,08 --> 00:35:51,25
Well, that's cold.

598
00:35:53,00 --> 00:35:54,12
Even for you.

599
00:35:56,16 --> 00:35:59,58
I told you upfront
the struggle will always come first.

600
00:35:59,66 --> 00:36:01,00
We take what's left.

601
00:36:12,25 --> 00:36:13,79
I'm a mirror, Vel.

602
00:36:15,95 --> 00:36:19,00
You love me because I show you
what you need to see.

603
00:36:21,95 --> 00:36:22,95
Thank you.

604
00:36:23,04 --> 00:36:24,12
Sure.

605
00:36:24,20 --> 00:36:25,62
Well, I'll keep an eye.

606
00:36:41,04 --> 00:36:42,04
Paak?

607
00:36:44,45 --> 00:36:45,66
Are you as slow as I am?

608
00:36:45,75 --> 00:36:47,83
Yeah, losing the hotel
is not good for business.

609
00:36:47,91 --> 00:36:50,66
We need a meeting.
There's gotta be something we can do.

610
00:36:50,75 --> 00:36:53,62
-What's up?
-I need to look for something in the back.

611
00:36:54,83 --> 00:36:56,33
Not sure that's a good idea.

612
00:36:56,41 --> 00:36:58,50
-It's been off for a while.
-It's urgent.

613
00:37:01,25 --> 00:37:02,41
All right.

614
00:37:29,50 --> 00:37:30,54
Kleya?

615
00:37:34,00 --> 00:37:35,00
Kleya?

616
00:37:42,62 --> 00:37:44,20
It's the shop owner on Ferrix.

617
00:37:44,29 --> 00:37:46,83
She's trying to find Cassian Andor.
His mother is ill.

618
00:37:49,50 --> 00:37:51,70
We're not answering. We can't.

619
00:37:51,79 --> 00:37:53,33
She could show the right direction.

620
00:37:53,41 --> 00:37:54,41
She's asking us.

621
00:37:54,50 --> 00:37:55,75
She knows more than we do.

622
00:37:55,83 --> 00:37:57,41
So much more.
She might have a lead.

623
00:37:57,50 --> 00:37:59,41
More likely
it's the ISB working her radio.

624
00:37:59,50 --> 00:38:01,70
-You're guessing!
-And you're slipping!

625
00:38:05,00 --> 00:38:06,54
We're shutting down Ferrix.

626
00:38:06,62 --> 00:38:08,37
The code, the frequency, all of it.

627
00:38:08,45 --> 00:38:10,79
I'm thinking clearly and you're not.

628
00:38:13,12 --> 00:38:14,33
Tell me to shut it down.

629
00:38:17,79 --> 00:38:18,87
It's Andor.

630
00:38:20,16 --> 00:38:24,25
Knowing he's out there, knowing me,
not knowing what he knows.

631
00:38:26,54 --> 00:38:27,87
I took him on the Fondor.

632
00:38:28,87 --> 00:38:30,00
Was I insane?

633
00:38:30,08 --> 00:38:32,45
You were desperate
for Aldhani to work and it did.

634
00:38:32,54 --> 00:38:34,58
And we'll find him, just not like this.

635
00:38:34,66 --> 00:38:36,00
Vel was out hunting.

636
00:38:36,08 --> 00:38:37,16
She and Cinta.

637
00:38:37,25 --> 00:38:39,16
-Are they in Ferrix yet?
-I'll have a listen.

638
00:38:39,25 --> 00:38:41,16
We're being extremely careful with it.

639
00:38:42,20 --> 00:38:44,33
The woman's name is Bix Caleen.

640
00:38:44,41 --> 00:38:46,12
Vel could have a look if it's safe.

641
00:38:46,20 --> 00:38:47,79
They know what they're doing.

642
00:38:51,16 --> 00:38:52,58
I'm not slipping, Kleya.

643
00:38:53,66 --> 00:38:55,20
I've just been hiding for too long.

644
00:38:56,00 --> 00:38:57,41
It's all different now.

645
00:38:57,50 --> 00:38:58,75
We're going loud.

646
00:38:58,83 --> 00:39:00,75
Vulnerability is inevitable.

647
00:39:01,79 --> 00:39:02,83
I'm not slipping.

648
00:39:03,66 --> 00:39:04,79
I know.

649
00:39:04,87 --> 00:39:06,54
I just need you to wake up.

650
00:39:06,62 --> 00:39:08,16
There's a lot to do.

651
00:39:10,29 --> 00:39:11,29
Shut it down.

652
00:40:28,83 --> 00:40:31,54
Coordinate alternatives for Segra Milo.

653
00:40:31,62 --> 00:40:32,62
<i>Calculating.</i>

654
00:40:33,70 --> 00:40:34,83
<i>Four potential routes.</i>

655
00:40:34,91 --> 00:40:36,50
Let's take the long way around.

656
00:40:37,75 --> 00:40:39,54
<i>Re-routing Segra Milo.</i>

657
00:41:01,87 --> 00:41:03,20
No, no, no, no!

658
00:41:03,29 --> 00:41:04,29
Aw, man.

659
00:41:04,37 --> 00:41:05,70
-Who is it now?
-No!

660
00:41:05,79 --> 00:41:06,79
He railed it!

661
00:41:06,87 --> 00:41:08,25
-Who?
-Veemoss!

662
00:41:08,33 --> 00:41:09,41
Veemoss!

663
00:41:09,50 --> 00:41:11,20
Table three, the tall one.

664
00:41:11,29 --> 00:41:12,91
He fell! Or jumped!

665
00:41:13,33 --> 00:41:15,54
Aw, man, well,
we'll be smellin' him all night.

666
00:41:15,62 --> 00:41:17,33
Here? He rails it here?

667
00:41:17,41 --> 00:41:18,91
He was slipping. You could see it.

668
00:41:19,00 --> 00:41:21,70
I don't care, man.
You rail here at night, I got no sympathy.

669
00:41:21,79 --> 00:41:22,79
Shut up about it.

670
00:41:22,87 --> 00:41:24,58
You'll be shorthanded
all day tomorrow.

671
00:41:24,66 --> 00:41:26,54
Think about that
when you're gettin' fried.

672
00:41:26,62 --> 00:41:28,58
Enough! Let's quiet down!

673
00:41:28,66 --> 00:41:30,91
<i>Level five, grid disruption.</i>

674
00:41:31,50 --> 00:41:34,37
<i>You have ten seconds</i>
<i>to get to your sleeping platforms.</i>

675
00:41:49,91 --> 00:41:51,70
Move, move, move!

676
00:41:54,91 --> 00:41:55,91
What's going on?

677
00:41:56,00 --> 00:41:57,00
It's Paak's yard.

678
00:41:57,08 --> 00:41:58,87
I'm not sure. They're all over it.

679
00:42:04,91 --> 00:42:05,95
Detained for what?

680
00:42:07,04 --> 00:42:08,41
Why won't you tell me?

681
00:42:08,50 --> 00:42:10,33
Where are they taking my father?

682
00:42:10,41 --> 00:42:12,12
Tell me! Where is he?

683
00:42:12,20 --> 00:42:13,50
Where is my father?

684
00:42:13,58 --> 00:42:15,41
-Shut him up!
-Silence!

685
00:42:19,29 --> 00:42:21,41
-What's going on?
-They took Paak in last night.

686
00:42:21,50 --> 00:42:24,45
-Where?
-The hotel. He never came home.

687
00:42:25,29 --> 00:42:27,75
Get these people back. I want a perimeter.

688
00:42:27,83 --> 00:42:30,29
Two and two, up and down, clear the lane!

689
00:42:30,37 --> 00:42:31,37
Yes, sir!

690
00:42:32,70 --> 00:42:34,79
-Let's go!
-You okay?

691
00:42:35,83 --> 00:42:37,91
-I don't know.
-Move it.

692
00:42:38,00 --> 00:42:39,91
Let's go, let's go!

693
00:42:40,00 --> 00:42:41,16
Get out of the way!

694
00:42:42,00 --> 00:42:43,08
Move it!

695
00:42:47,00 --> 00:42:48,08
Caleen!

696
00:42:50,20 --> 00:42:51,25
Bix Caleen!

697
00:42:52,70 --> 00:42:54,08
That's your name, isn't it?

698
00:42:55,08 --> 00:42:57,00
If not, the resemblance is quite striking.

699
00:42:57,08 --> 00:42:58,50
Get to Zorby's. Run!

700
00:42:59,29 --> 00:43:00,66
Get her!

701
00:43:00,75 --> 00:43:03,54
-Move! Move! Move!
-Sorry. Excuse me. Sorry.

702
00:43:04,16 --> 00:43:05,16
Go!

703
00:43:10,79 --> 00:43:12,16
Get her!

704
00:43:35,08 --> 00:43:40,83
So, my friend,
the garrison at Aldhani, was that you?

705
00:43:40,91 --> 00:43:43,33
I was just about to ask you
the same thing.

706
00:43:43,41 --> 00:43:44,95
You'd never tell me if it was.

707
00:43:46,08 --> 00:43:47,58
Somebody's sitting on some dosh.

708
00:43:47,66 --> 00:43:49,83
If it's you,
I'm hoping you'll put it to good use.

709
00:43:49,91 --> 00:43:51,95
Would I be out here in the cold

710
00:43:52,04 --> 00:43:54,33
if I had just pinched
a 100 million credits?

711
00:43:54,41 --> 00:43:56,08
That's exactly what you'd do.

712
00:43:58,00 --> 00:44:00,75
And that's exactly
what I would say if I were you.

713
00:44:00,83 --> 00:44:03,66
If you're trying to convince me
it was you, it's working.

714
00:44:04,50 --> 00:44:05,75
Let's agree.

715
00:44:05,83 --> 00:44:08,04
-It was a masterpiece.
-Well, now I'm sure.

716
00:44:11,87 --> 00:44:15,41
Aren't you tired of playing
behind the scenes, Luthen?

717
00:44:15,50 --> 00:44:18,29
Aren't you tired of fighting
with people who agree with you?

718
00:44:18,37 --> 00:44:19,87
You come all this way to scold me?

719
00:44:21,45 --> 00:44:23,25
Or did you bring me some toys?

720
00:44:23,54 --> 00:44:24,62
Hmm.

721
00:44:24,70 --> 00:44:26,20
I did, but they're not for free.

722
00:44:26,29 --> 00:44:27,37
Nothing with you is free.

723
00:44:27,45 --> 00:44:29,75
Not every operation is as flush as yours.

724
00:44:31,41 --> 00:44:32,50
Tell me what you've got.

725
00:44:32,58 --> 00:44:36,04
Well, how about a full set
of Imperial drive adapters?

726
00:44:36,12 --> 00:44:39,29
I've also got three sealed
Steergard targeting deflectors.

727
00:44:39,54 --> 00:44:40,54
Mmm.

728
00:44:40,75 --> 00:44:43,37
You have this all here with you?

729
00:44:46,29 --> 00:44:47,29
At what cost?

730
00:44:48,45 --> 00:44:49,54
Anto Kreegyr.

731
00:44:50,45 --> 00:44:53,29
-I want you to meet him.
-Anto Kreegyr?

732
00:44:53,37 --> 00:44:56,08
He's been probing
the Imperial power station at Spellhaus.

733
00:44:56,16 --> 00:44:57,91
He's found a weakness in the defenses.

734
00:44:58,00 --> 00:45:00,62
It may take some time to work up,
but he's got an angle.

735
00:45:00,70 --> 00:45:01,91
The man's an ox!

736
00:45:02,00 --> 00:45:03,87
Slow! And stupid!

737
00:45:03,95 --> 00:45:04,95
And strong.

738
00:45:05,04 --> 00:45:07,37
I want you to hear his plan.
He'll need air support.

739
00:45:07,45 --> 00:45:08,66
Let's just keep this simple.

740
00:45:08,75 --> 00:45:11,45
I'll take all three deflectors. How much?

741
00:45:11,54 --> 00:45:13,54
Well, you meet with Kreegyr, they're free.

742
00:45:13,62 --> 00:45:15,54
-You don't, I won't sell.
-I work alone.

743
00:45:15,62 --> 00:45:17,04
That's what I'm trying to change.

744
00:45:17,12 --> 00:45:20,45
I'm not gonna put my people
at risk for someone else.

745
00:45:20,54 --> 00:45:22,29
We need to pull together, Saw!

746
00:45:24,50 --> 00:45:26,62
Whatever our final version
of success looks like,

747
00:45:26,70 --> 00:45:29,50
there's no chance any of us
can make it real on our own.

748
00:45:30,45 --> 00:45:31,87
We need the Empire to help.

749
00:45:31,95 --> 00:45:33,12
We need them angry.

750
00:45:33,20 --> 00:45:34,87
We need them coming down hard.

751
00:45:37,04 --> 00:45:38,66
Oppression breeds rebellion.

752
00:45:40,20 --> 00:45:41,33
Kreegyr needs air support.

753
00:45:41,41 --> 00:45:43,00
-I'm not for hire.
-Think of it.

754
00:45:44,20 --> 00:45:46,41
Think of Spellhaus in flames.

755
00:45:46,50 --> 00:45:49,00
Neither of you could do it on your own,
but together...

756
00:45:49,08 --> 00:45:51,08
Kreegyr's a separatist.

757
00:45:52,00 --> 00:45:53,75
Maya Pei's a neo-Republican.

758
00:45:54,62 --> 00:45:56,45
The Ghorman front.

759
00:45:56,54 --> 00:45:58,16
The Partisan alliance?

760
00:45:58,87 --> 00:45:59,87
Sectorists.

761
00:45:59,95 --> 00:46:01,50
Human cultists?

762
00:46:01,58 --> 00:46:03,29
Galaxy partitionists.

763
00:46:03,37 --> 00:46:04,41
They're lost!

764
00:46:05,12 --> 00:46:06,33
All of them, lost!

765
00:46:07,66 --> 00:46:08,66
Lost!

766
00:46:14,75 --> 00:46:16,91
What are you, Luthen?

767
00:46:19,95 --> 00:46:21,20
I've never really known.

768
00:46:23,66 --> 00:46:24,66
What are you?

769
00:46:29,16 --> 00:46:30,79
I'm a coward.

770
00:46:31,83 --> 00:46:33,25
I'm a man who's terrified

771
00:46:33,33 --> 00:46:35,62
the Empire's power
will grow beyond the point

772
00:46:35,70 --> 00:46:37,58
where we can do anything to stop it.

773
00:46:37,66 --> 00:46:38,79
I'm the one who says,

774
00:46:38,87 --> 00:46:42,54
"We'll die with nothing if we don't put
aside our petty differences."

775
00:46:42,62 --> 00:46:43,66
Petty?

776
00:46:45,62 --> 00:46:50,33
I am the only one with clarity of purpose.

777
00:46:53,37 --> 00:46:56,20
Well, anarchy is a seductive concept.

778
00:46:57,45 --> 00:47:01,33
A bit of a luxury I'd argue
to a man who is hiding in cold caves,

779
00:47:02,16 --> 00:47:03,66
and begging for spare parts.

780
00:47:13,79 --> 00:47:15,16
No sale today, Luthen.

781
00:47:16,00 --> 00:47:17,41
Good luck with Anto Kreegyr.

782
00:47:34,50 --> 00:47:36,08
She's on her way up.

783
00:47:36,16 --> 00:47:37,75
Would you like us to clear the room?

784
00:47:37,83 --> 00:47:38,83
No.

785
00:47:39,50 --> 00:47:40,75
I want her to see him.

786
00:47:52,83 --> 00:47:55,54
What are you doing?
Get him out of here.

787
00:47:56,20 --> 00:47:58,29
-Quickly.
-You two, with me.

788
00:47:59,04 --> 00:48:00,04
Now!

789
00:48:01,41 --> 00:48:02,75
-Paak.

790
00:48:04,87 --> 00:48:06,37
Paak. Hey.

791
00:48:15,25 --> 00:48:16,41
Hello, Bix.

792
00:48:31,62 --> 00:48:33,45
-Let's go!
-Come on, come on!

793
00:48:33,54 --> 00:48:34,58
Hands away!

794
00:48:34,66 --> 00:48:35,70
Clear!

795
00:48:37,12 --> 00:48:38,16
Good?

796
00:48:40,25 --> 00:48:41,29
All right.

797
00:48:41,37 --> 00:48:43,16
Okay, ready?

798
00:48:44,20 --> 00:48:46,37
-Bring it. Bring it in.
-Come on, boys, yes.

799
00:48:58,54 --> 00:48:59,95
It's good, it's good.
