00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:02,04
KRAVAS: Stop right there!

2
00:00:02,12 --> 00:00:04,29
You're in Pre-Mor corporate zone.
You know that, right?

3
00:00:04,37 --> 00:00:05,95



4
00:00:06,04 --> 00:00:07,83
He's not breathing. You killed him.

5
00:00:09,04 --> 00:00:12,04
B2EMO: <i>"P-P-Pre-Mor Authority</i>
<i>is seeking a Kenari male resident</i>

6
00:00:12,12 --> 00:00:13,20
<i>"of Ferrix for questioning.</i>

00:00:19,25 --> 00:00:20,25
We have a suspect?

10
00:00:20,33 --> 00:00:21,66
FEMALE OFFICER: <i>Cassian Andor.</i>

<i>"assault on Imperial soldier."</i>

Who else knows
that you were born in Kenari?

14
00:00:27,70 --> 00:00:31,29
-B-B-Bix. Bix is looking for you.
-Bix has nothing to do with this!

15
00:00:31,37 --> 00:00:34,41
But then who told these
Pre-Mor bastards about Kenari?

16
00:00:34,50 --> 00:00:35,62
XANWAN: <i>"Kenari.</i>

17
00:00:37,20 --> 00:00:39,87
<i>"Abandoned after</i>
<i>Imperial mining disaster."</i>

18
00:00:39,95 --> 00:00:41,95
<i>-Everyone died.</i>


19
00:00:42,04 --> 00:00:44,45
SERGEANT MOSK: <i>Andor should be considered</i>
<i>armed and dangerous.</i>

20
00:00:44,54 --> 00:00:46,87
<i>He may not appear to be</i>
<i>a formidable opponent,</i>

21
00:00:46,95 --> 00:00:49,79
but two of our men are dead
having made that mistake.

22
00:00:49,87 --> 00:00:52,66
-CASSIAN: I have something to sell.
-What?

23
00:00:52,75 --> 00:00:54,62
CASSIAN: <i>An untraceable</i>
<i>NS-9 Starpath unit.</i>

24
00:00:54,70 --> 00:00:56,87
-BIX: <i>Do you know how much that's worth?</i>
-CASSIAN: <i>Yeah.</i>

25
00:00:56,95 --> 00:00:59,62
<i>Enough to get out of here,</i>
<i>lay low till things cool off.</i>

26
00:01:00,16 --> 00:01:01,87
<i>Your friend will want this piece.</i>

27
00:01:01,95 --> 00:01:02,95
<i>He'll come for this.</i>

28
00:02:09,83 --> 00:02:12,54


29
00:02:13,54 --> 00:02:15,70


30
00:02:27,00 --> 00:02:28,41


31
00:02:28,50 --> 00:02:30,12


32
00:02:36,66 --> 00:02:39,12



33
00:02:45,29 --> 00:02:46,29


34
00:03:17,00 --> 00:03:18,04


35
00:03:18,12 --> 00:03:19,45


36
00:03:22,58 --> 00:03:24,37


37
00:03:25,04 --> 00:03:26,41


38
00:03:26,50 --> 00:03:28,50

00:03:29,75 --> 00:03:32,04



40
00:04:02,87 --> 00:04:03,95

00:04:22,20 --> 00:04:24,58


42
00:04:26,25 --> 00:04:27,25


43
00:04:31,95 --> 00:04:33,70


44
00:04:38,54 --> 00:04:40,95
All right, she's clear. Yeah, that's it.

45
00:04:43,37 --> 00:04:44,95
MAN 1: Standby for the detach.

46
00:04:45,04 --> 00:04:46,37
-MAN 2: It's good?
-MAN 1: It's good.

47
00:04:46,45 --> 00:04:48,41
-MAN 3: Bring more over here.
-MAN 1: Slow it down.

48
00:04:48,50 --> 00:04:49,83
MAN 4: Bring the tester over here.

49
00:04:49,95 --> 00:04:52,00
-MAN 1: Release the catch.
-MAN 2: Clear it out.

50
00:04:52,08 --> 00:04:53,58
Go for the detach.

51
00:04:53,66 --> 00:04:54,95
MAN 5: Watch the twelve-eight.

52
00:05:02,33 --> 00:05:03,50
MAN 5: You got this one.

53
00:05:07,91 --> 00:05:09,83
MAN 1: Still get a reading
off of this one.

54
00:05:09,91 --> 00:05:11,12
MAN 6: It's still live.

55
00:05:12,87 --> 00:05:13,91
CASSIAN: Hey.

56
00:05:14,00 --> 00:05:16,00
I think I have some money on the way.

57
00:05:16,08 --> 00:05:17,66
If it comes through, I'm out of here.

58
00:05:17,75 --> 00:05:19,70
When? 

59
00:05:19,79 --> 00:05:20,79
CASSIAN: Today.

60
00:05:21,83 --> 00:05:24,62
-That doesn't sound good.
-I'll leave money with Maarva.

61
00:05:24,70 --> 00:05:26,16
She'll have what I owe you.

62
00:05:26,25 --> 00:05:28,45

Keep an eye on her if you can.

63
00:05:29,08 --> 00:05:30,12
Where are you going?

64
00:05:30,20 --> 00:05:32,20
It's better you don't know.


65
00:05:32,29 --> 00:05:33,50
I'll be back.

66
00:05:33,58 --> 00:05:35,00
I'll find a way.

67
00:05:41,20 --> 00:05:43,04


68
00:05:46,12 --> 00:05:47,79


69
00:05:51,16 --> 00:05:52,54


70
00:05:54,70 --> 00:05:57,00

-ANNOUNCER: <i>Welcome to Ferrix Terminal.</i>

71
00:05:57,54 --> 00:06:00,00
<i>Please make sure to check</i>
<i>your belongings before departing.</i>

72
00:06:00,08 --> 00:06:01,12


73
00:06:01,20 --> 00:06:05,58
<i>Shuttle ferry discount ticket packages</i>
<i>are available at the dispatch kiosk.</i>

74
00:06:07,33 --> 00:06:09,04
WILLI: Not staying at the hotel, are you?

75
00:06:10,20 --> 00:06:11,25
Not tonight.

76
00:06:11,33 --> 00:06:12,50
Smart choice.

77
00:06:12,58 --> 00:06:14,25
It's the ultimate Ferrix gouge.

78
00:06:16,75 --> 00:06:17,83
Mind your wallet!

79
00:06:22,95 --> 00:06:26,12


80
00:06:37,20 --> 00:06:38,20
Thank you.

81
00:06:41,16 --> 00:06:43,91
There's been a complication.
I missed the window to call back.

82
00:06:44,00 --> 00:06:45,20
LUTHEN: Calmly.

83
00:06:45,29 --> 00:06:47,66
Pre-Mor Enforcement
put out a bulletin last night

84
00:06:47,75 --> 00:06:49,58
for someone meeting Cassian's description.

85
00:06:49,66 --> 00:06:50,91
I've seen it.

86
00:06:51,00 --> 00:06:52,87
The bulletin doesn't mention him by name.

87
00:06:52,95 --> 00:06:55,41
It says they're looking
for someone from Kenari.

88
00:06:55,50 --> 00:06:57,83
His Imperial prison record
says he's from Fest.

89
00:06:57,91 --> 00:06:59,58
Yeah, that's always been his story.

90
00:07:00,91 --> 00:07:02,54
Has he been identified?

91
00:07:02,62 --> 00:07:04,37
I don't think many people know him.

92
00:07:05,91 --> 00:07:07,58
He killed these men on Morlana?

93
00:07:09,66 --> 00:07:11,62
Oh, then we better be quick about it.

94
00:07:13,20 --> 00:07:14,37
Where is he?

95
00:07:14,45 --> 00:07:16,29
BIX: East lot. Building nine.

96
00:07:18,62 --> 00:07:19,75
LUTHEN: You trust him?

97
00:07:20,45 --> 00:07:21,45
BIX: He'll be there.

98
00:07:27,20 --> 00:07:28,83


99
00:07:28,91 --> 00:07:30,79


100
00:07:35,04 --> 00:07:36,45


101
00:07:37,58 --> 00:07:40,12



102
00:08:04,33 --> 00:08:06,37


103
00:08:14,37 --> 00:08:16,16
B2EMO: Vapor density acceptable.

104
00:08:16,25 --> 00:08:18,00
Airborne concentration minimal.

105
00:08:18,08 --> 00:08:20,25
No detectable gas toxicity.

106
00:08:20,33 --> 00:08:22,20
MAARVA: There. Are we satisfied?

107
00:08:22,29 --> 00:08:24,66
 Let's get that console unit.

108
00:08:24,75 --> 00:08:26,41
Maybe we should quit while we're ahead.

109
00:08:26,50 --> 00:08:27,95
MAARVA: Are you listening? It's safe.

110
00:08:28,04 --> 00:08:29,41
Whatever it was, it's burned off.

111
00:08:29,50 --> 00:08:30,79
Just get your mask off.

112
00:08:30,87 --> 00:08:32,04



113
00:08:32,12 --> 00:08:33,79
 Time, not gas.

114
00:08:33,87 --> 00:08:36,04
We said 20 minutes tops.

115
00:08:36,29 --> 00:08:37,41


116
00:08:38,00 --> 00:08:39,58
I don't want to know what that is.

117
00:08:39,66 --> 00:08:43,62
There must be at least six
brand-new fuel nodules up ahead.

118
00:08:43,70 --> 00:08:45,33
We got more than we can carry already.

119
00:08:45,41 --> 00:08:47,04
What's the asking price
of those today, Bee?

120
00:08:47,12 --> 00:08:48,62
For sale or barter?

121
00:08:48,70 --> 00:08:49,87
Are you kidding?

122
00:08:49,95 --> 00:08:51,41


123
00:08:51,50 --> 00:08:53,41
We need to leave now!

124
00:08:54,00 --> 00:08:55,00
Could be anything.

125
00:08:55,08 --> 00:08:56,29


126
00:08:56,37 --> 00:08:59,12
Well, in that case,
by all means, let's plow forward.

127
00:09:00,75 --> 00:09:02,16


128
00:09:05,37 --> 00:09:07,83


129
00:09:12,37 --> 00:09:14,41


130
00:09:16,70 --> 00:09:17,87


131
00:09:18,37 --> 00:09:20,04
-CLEM: I like your spirit, son.


132
00:09:21,00 --> 00:09:23,70
You just might not want to be here
when they come to clean up.

133
00:09:24,62 --> 00:09:25,62


134
00:09:25,70 --> 00:09:27,79


135
00:09:30,20 --> 00:09:31,79
 He doesn't understand you.

136
00:09:33,37 --> 00:09:34,79
Republic frigate approaching.

137
00:09:35,20 --> 00:09:37,04


138
00:09:39,75 --> 00:09:42,00


139
00:09:43,54 --> 00:09:46,16


140
00:09:59,08 --> 00:10:01,12


141
00:10:02,16 --> 00:10:03,62


142
00:10:07,75 --> 00:10:09,04


143
00:10:16,66 --> 00:10:17,70
West Team on site.

144
00:10:20,91 --> 00:10:22,33
East Team, sitrep, over.

145
00:10:22,41 --> 00:10:24,70
SOLDIER 1: <i>East Team inbound on approach.</i>

146
00:10:24,79 --> 00:10:26,20
<i>Three minutes from LZ.</i>

147
00:10:27,04 --> 00:10:28,41
SERGEANT MOSK: North Team, sitrep?

148
00:10:29,20 --> 00:10:30,95
SOLDIER 2: <i>North Team here. We're on site.</i>

149
00:10:31,83 --> 00:10:33,75
SERGEANT MOSK:
Copy that, North Team. Stand by.

150
00:10:35,37 --> 00:10:36,45


151
00:10:36,54 --> 00:10:37,91


152
00:10:38,83 --> 00:10:40,87


153
00:10:45,08 --> 00:10:46,87
-Haven't seen any Blues in a while.


154
00:10:48,12 --> 00:10:49,45
What the hell are they doin'?

155
00:10:50,33 --> 00:10:52,04
-Hunting for somebody.


156
00:10:55,33 --> 00:10:57,66


157
00:11:07,58 --> 00:11:08,79


158
00:11:08,87 --> 00:11:10,29


159
00:11:12,25 --> 00:11:14,66
 It's gonna take nine minutes
to get back to the hauler.

160
00:11:14,75 --> 00:11:16,04
And leave him here?

161
00:11:16,12 --> 00:11:18,41
-Is that what you're suggesting?
-Let him run.

162
00:11:18,50 --> 00:11:19,79


163
00:11:19,87 --> 00:11:21,75
-We're trying to help you.


164
00:11:21,83 --> 00:11:24,33
-Where's the Republic ship?
-Orbiting now.

165
00:11:24,41 --> 00:11:26,16
-They'll kill him.
-They'll kill us.

166
00:11:26,25 --> 00:11:27,91
Bee, get me the Drowser.

167
00:11:28,62 --> 00:11:30,00
No. Maarva, no.

168
00:11:30,08 --> 00:11:32,33
-MAARVA: Shut up, Clem.
-He's got people here.

169
00:11:32,41 --> 00:11:34,62
Yeah, people who've just killed
a Republic officer.

170
00:11:34,70 --> 00:11:36,91
It'll be open season here
the moment that frigate lands.

171
00:11:37,00 --> 00:11:39,25



172
00:11:39,91 --> 00:11:40,91


173
00:11:41,00 --> 00:11:42,04


174
00:11:43,87 --> 00:11:45,62
You better think about this.

175
00:11:45,70 --> 00:11:47,41
Plenty of time for that.

176
00:11:47,50 --> 00:11:49,66
I'm not leaving him here to die. 

177
00:11:50,37 --> 00:11:52,87
-SOLDIER 2: Have you searched yet?
-SOLDIER 3: Uh, not yet, no.

178
00:11:52,95 --> 00:11:54,16
East Team on site.

179
00:11:54,83 --> 00:11:56,79
East Team, secure the position.

180
00:11:56,87 --> 00:11:57,91
SOLDIER 1: <i>Copy that.</i>

181
00:11:58,41 --> 00:11:59,45


182
00:12:02,33 --> 00:12:03,33


183
00:12:07,70 --> 00:12:08,75


184
00:12:08,83 --> 00:12:10,95


185
00:12:11,04 --> 00:12:12,70
We have a warrant for Cassian Andor.

186
00:12:12,79 --> 00:12:13,79


187
00:12:17,08 --> 00:12:18,08


188
00:12:24,54 --> 00:12:27,04
Why's all that stuff
still piled up in the alley?

189
00:12:27,12 --> 00:12:29,41
Thought you wanted
to get it out this morning.

190
00:12:29,50 --> 00:12:31,33
I do. I just forgot. 

191
00:12:40,20 --> 00:12:41,79


192
00:12:42,62 --> 00:12:43,91
SYRIL: Check the shelves!

193
00:12:44,00 --> 00:12:45,25
Pull that down.

194
00:12:47,16 --> 00:12:49,41
You ought to be ashamed of yourself.

195
00:12:50,75 --> 00:12:53,62
You can stop this any time you want
by telling us where to find him.

196
00:12:55,04 --> 00:12:56,08
SERGEANT MOSK: Sir.

197
00:12:58,25 --> 00:12:59,25
Keep her there.

198
00:12:59,33 --> 00:13:01,37
SERGEANT MOSK:
Got another resident here, sir.

199
00:13:04,79 --> 00:13:06,95
SYRIL:  Where's Cassian, droid?

200
00:13:07,04 --> 00:13:08,16
M-M-Maarva!

201
00:13:08,25 --> 00:13:10,04
-Pull his power supply.
-No!

202
00:13:10,12 --> 00:13:11,75
Don't let them scare you, Bee.

203
00:13:11,83 --> 00:13:13,20
They can't do that.

204
00:13:13,29 --> 00:13:14,79
-They're in our home.
-Shut her up!

205
00:13:14,87 --> 00:13:16,95


206
00:13:17,04 --> 00:13:18,37


207
00:13:18,50 --> 00:13:20,12


208
00:13:21,62 --> 00:13:23,00
CASSIAN: Bee, are you back yet?

209
00:13:23,79 --> 00:13:25,87
<i>Please tell me these things</i>
<i>are working, Bee.</i>

210
00:13:27,08 --> 00:13:28,33
Bee, respond.

211
00:13:28,41 --> 00:13:29,41


212
00:13:29,50 --> 00:13:30,70
<i>Are you recharging?</i>

213
00:13:34,79 --> 00:13:36,75
I want you to tell Maarva that I'm sorry.

214
00:13:36,83 --> 00:13:37,83


215
00:13:37,91 --> 00:13:39,37
<i>I forgot to tell you that.</i>

216
00:13:40,50 --> 00:13:43,25
<i>And, uh, make sure she keeps</i>
<i>the heat on too.</i>

217
00:13:43,33 --> 00:13:45,45
-SERGEANT MOSK: East.
-CASSIAN: <i>You know how cold she gets.</i>

218
00:13:45,54 --> 00:13:47,83
East. East-northeast. Got it.

219
00:13:47,91 --> 00:13:50,20
-Leave one man here?
-CASSIAN: <i>Bee, are you reading me?</i>

220
00:13:50,29 --> 00:13:51,29
<i>Please come in.</i>

221
00:13:51,37 --> 00:13:53,41
-SERGEANT MOSK: Drawin' a crowd.


222
00:13:53,50 --> 00:13:54,83
I'd say two, sir.

223
00:13:55,45 --> 00:13:57,54
Call East Team. Tell 'em we're on our way.

224
00:13:57,62 --> 00:13:59,70
SERGEANT MOSK:
You two, come with me. Stay here.

225
00:13:59,79 --> 00:14:01,83
-CASSIAN: <i>Are you hearing me?</i>
-Keep an eye on 'em.

226
00:14:02,79 --> 00:14:04,41
Bee, are you getting this?

227
00:14:06,12 --> 00:14:08,25
-Resp...


228
00:14:11,12 --> 00:14:12,16
LUTHEN: Andor?

229
00:14:18,00 --> 00:14:19,00
You made it.

230
00:14:21,91 --> 00:14:22,91


231
00:14:23,29 --> 00:14:24,58
Are we alone?

232
00:14:25,25 --> 00:14:26,25
I am.

233
00:14:26,62 --> 00:14:27,62


234
00:14:27,70 --> 00:14:29,75
-WOMAN: What'd you do with Maarva?
-She's an old woman!

235
00:14:29,83 --> 00:14:32,62
All right, now, back off. Back off.

236
00:14:32,70 --> 00:14:34,12
Nothing to see here.

237
00:14:34,20 --> 00:14:35,54
Business as usual.

238
00:14:35,62 --> 00:14:36,83
Serving a warrant.

239
00:14:36,91 --> 00:14:38,70
Corporate authority. Back off.

240
00:14:38,79 --> 00:14:40,87


241
00:14:41,00 --> 00:14:42,12
How far?

242
00:14:42,20 --> 00:14:43,62
A ten-minute walk.

243
00:14:43,70 --> 00:14:45,45
East Team will secure the site.

244
00:14:46,87 --> 00:14:48,83
-LUTHEN: For how much?
-Forty thousand.

245
00:14:51,25 --> 00:14:52,45
LUTHEN: Forty thousand?

246
00:14:52,54 --> 00:14:54,79
CASSIAN: Forty thousand credits is cheap.

247
00:14:55,45 --> 00:14:56,45
Is it?

248
00:14:56,54 --> 00:14:57,54


249
00:14:57,62 --> 00:14:59,41
An untraceable Starpath Unit.

250
00:14:59,50 --> 00:15:01,91
Vector crystals and seal still intact.

251
00:15:02,00 --> 00:15:05,33
You can track every Imperial coordinate
for nine radial parsecs.

252
00:15:05,41 --> 00:15:06,62
LUTHEN: Is it here?

253
00:15:06,70 --> 00:15:07,95
Is the money here?

254
00:15:08,70 --> 00:15:10,58
How do I know it works?

255
00:15:11,16 --> 00:15:12,16
CASSIAN: It's sealed.

256
00:15:12,25 --> 00:15:14,41
The moment I plug it in, the value drops.

257
00:15:14,50 --> 00:15:16,54
So you could be scamming me. 

258
00:15:18,83 --> 00:15:20,08
CASSIAN: I'm giving you my word.

259
00:15:20,79 --> 00:15:22,20
LUTHEN: And if that's not enough?

260
00:15:23,08 --> 00:15:24,20


261
00:15:24,45 --> 00:15:26,16
 You know where I live.

262
00:15:27,00 --> 00:15:29,79
So I could come back
if I were dissatisfied.

263
00:15:31,50 --> 00:15:32,50


264
00:15:32,58 --> 00:15:34,54
Has Bix ever burned you before?

265
00:15:35,29 --> 00:15:37,45
You're planning
on sticking around, are you?

266
00:15:38,29 --> 00:15:39,75


267
00:15:41,12 --> 00:15:42,12


268
00:15:44,29 --> 00:15:46,41
SALMAN: There's a bunch of Corpos
looking for Cassian.

269
00:15:46,50 --> 00:15:47,66
-Wilmon saw them.
-Here?

270
00:15:47,75 --> 00:15:49,37
-They're down at Maarva's.
-BIX: No.

271
00:15:49,45 --> 00:15:51,70
What in the name of Chobb
has he done this time?

272
00:15:51,79 --> 00:15:52,79
 Oh, God.

273
00:15:52,87 --> 00:15:54,95
There was a bulletin last night.
Did you see it?

274
00:15:55,04 --> 00:15:56,37
"Kenari male resident."

275
00:15:57,33 --> 00:15:59,16
 I need to think.
Just let me think.

276
00:15:59,25 --> 00:16:00,62
Is that what this is about?

277
00:16:00,70 --> 00:16:02,20


278
00:16:03,25 --> 00:16:04,54
Someone ratted him out.

279
00:16:04,62 --> 00:16:06,12
SALMAN: What? What do you mean?

280
00:16:06,20 --> 00:16:08,08
-I need to go find him.
-SALMAN: No. Bix, no.

281
00:16:08,16 --> 00:16:10,25
-Someone has to.
-SALMAN: He could be anywhere. Tell her.

282
00:16:10,33 --> 00:16:11,62
Don't.

283
00:16:11,70 --> 00:16:13,29
Don't? Don't what?

284
00:16:14,20 --> 00:16:15,70
He can take care of himself.

285
00:16:15,79 --> 00:16:16,83


286
00:16:16,95 --> 00:16:18,00
Who?

287
00:16:18,79 --> 00:16:20,83
How do you know who we're talking about?

288
00:16:25,58 --> 00:16:28,25
Did I ever tell you
that Cassian was born on Kenari?

289
00:16:29,54 --> 00:16:31,50
-I don't... I don't... I don't remember.
-Hmm?

290
00:16:32,66 --> 00:16:33,70
BIX: I do.

291
00:16:34,95 --> 00:16:36,12
I remember.

292
00:16:36,91 --> 00:16:37,91


293
00:16:38,00 --> 00:16:39,37
 How could you?

294
00:16:39,45 --> 00:16:41,95
Wait. 
What is going on?

295
00:16:42,04 --> 00:16:43,70
I can't believe you'd do that.

296
00:16:46,54 --> 00:16:48,08
What did you do?

297
00:16:49,00 --> 00:16:50,12
Timm!

298
00:16:53,50 --> 00:16:54,70
LUTHEN: Where'd you get it?

299
00:16:54,79 --> 00:16:56,62
CASSIAN: What difference does that make?

300
00:16:56,70 --> 00:16:58,45
I see three choices.

301
00:16:58,54 --> 00:17:00,29
Either you're an Imperial spy,

302
00:17:00,37 --> 00:17:02,95
you're fronting for the person
I really want to speak to,

303
00:17:03,04 --> 00:17:04,41
or you're the thing itself.

304
00:17:04,50 --> 00:17:05,79
I see one choice.

305
00:17:05,87 --> 00:17:07,79
Either you got my money or you don't.

306
00:17:11,50 --> 00:17:12,50


307
00:17:12,79 --> 00:17:14,00
LUTHEN: So which is it?

308
00:17:15,79 --> 00:17:17,08
I know Bix has her game.

309
00:17:17,16 --> 00:17:20,29
I know you bribe quartermasters
to leave valuables on the ships

310
00:17:20,37 --> 00:17:21,62
before they come in for scrap.

311
00:17:21,70 --> 00:17:23,20
But this isn't that.

312
00:17:23,29 --> 00:17:25,37
This isn't something they'd let pass.

313
00:17:26,29 --> 00:17:27,33
No.

314
00:17:27,91 --> 00:17:29,75
I went in and got this myself.

315
00:17:29,83 --> 00:17:31,37
How? How's that possible?

316
00:17:31,45 --> 00:17:34,83
It was... It was sealed
on the Imperial Naval Base in Steergard.

317
00:17:34,91 --> 00:17:36,83
Look, you got the money. I got the box.

318
00:17:36,91 --> 00:17:38,37
What else is there to talk about?

319
00:17:38,45 --> 00:17:41,33
I'll give you another thousand credits
to tell me how you got it.

320
00:17:41,41 --> 00:17:43,37
 Another thousand?

321
00:17:43,45 --> 00:17:44,45
LUTHEN: Done.

322
00:17:45,54 --> 00:17:46,62
How?

323
00:17:48,50 --> 00:17:49,50


324
00:17:52,25 --> 00:17:54,33
You just walk in like you belong.

325
00:17:55,08 --> 00:17:58,50
-Takes more than that, doesn't it?
-CASSIAN: What? To steal from the Empire?

326
00:17:59,08 --> 00:18:00,20
What do you need?

327
00:18:00,29 --> 00:18:03,20
A uniform, some dirty hands
and an Imperial tool kit.

328
00:18:03,87 --> 00:18:06,79
 They're so proud of themselves,
they don't even care.

329
00:18:08,04 --> 00:18:12,04
They're so fat and satisfied,
they can't imagine it.

330
00:18:12,12 --> 00:18:13,37
Can't imagine what?

331
00:18:14,16 --> 00:18:16,91
CASSIAN: That someone like me
would ever get inside their house,

332
00:18:17,00 --> 00:18:18,45
walk their floors,

333
00:18:18,54 --> 00:18:20,54
spit in their food, take their gear.

334
00:18:21,95 --> 00:18:24,08
The arrogance is remarkable, isn't it?

335
00:18:24,79 --> 00:18:26,54
They don't even think about us.

336
00:18:27,29 --> 00:18:29,66
Us? I don't know you.

337
00:18:29,75 --> 00:18:31,54
LUTHEN: Fair enough. But I know you.

338
00:18:33,08 --> 00:18:35,45
These days will end, Cassian Andor.

339
00:18:36,45 --> 00:18:39,33
The way they laugh.
The way they push through a crowd.

340
00:18:41,08 --> 00:18:44,87
The sound of that voice
telling you to stop, to go, to move.

341
00:18:46,00 --> 00:18:47,50
Telling you to die.

342
00:18:48,16 --> 00:18:49,75
Rings in the ear, doesn't it?

343
00:18:49,83 --> 00:18:51,83
CASSIAN: Why don't you let me
count that money?

344
00:18:52,41 --> 00:18:54,50
But they'll think about us soon enough.

345
00:18:54,58 --> 00:18:55,79
We should get moving.

346
00:18:56,37 --> 00:18:59,54
Soon enough,
they'll have something else to listen to.

347
00:18:59,62 --> 00:19:01,45
You don't want to get caught with it.

348
00:19:03,62 --> 00:19:05,75
Well, they'd hang me, wouldn't they?

349
00:19:05,83 --> 00:19:08,37
Take me up Rix Road
and hang me in the square.

350
00:19:09,12 --> 00:19:10,75
Wouldn't be the first time, would it?

351
00:19:12,08 --> 00:19:13,87
Isn't that where they hung your father?

352
00:19:15,08 --> 00:19:16,25
-Who are you?


353
00:19:17,66 --> 00:19:18,83
What is this?

354
00:19:21,00 --> 00:19:22,75
LUTHEN: I said I know you.

355
00:19:23,33 --> 00:19:24,91
I know all about you.

356
00:19:25,00 --> 00:19:26,25
Yes, I want the box,

357
00:19:26,33 --> 00:19:28,66
and I'll leave with that
if it's all I can get.

358
00:19:28,75 --> 00:19:31,62
I came looking for something more,
and I think I've found it.

359
00:19:34,41 --> 00:19:36,12
I'd like you to come with me.

360
00:19:36,20 --> 00:19:37,79
How do you know about me?

361
00:19:38,70 --> 00:19:40,91
I was hoping
for a more relaxed conversation,

362
00:19:41,00 --> 00:19:43,16
but you're right, we don't have time.

363
00:19:43,25 --> 00:19:46,75
Contrary to what you told me,
I doubt that you'll be stickin' around.

364
00:19:46,83 --> 00:19:49,00
I know you killed two Corpos
at Morlana-One,

365
00:19:49,08 --> 00:19:50,87
and I know they're coming for you.

366
00:19:50,95 --> 00:19:53,16
Seems like such a waste
to let them have you.

367
00:19:53,95 --> 00:19:55,29
Waste of talent.

368
00:19:56,00 --> 00:19:57,54
 Who are you?

369
00:19:57,62 --> 00:19:59,25
That's the wrong question.

370
00:20:00,33 --> 00:20:03,29
The right question is how much time
do we have to get out of here.

371
00:20:03,37 --> 00:20:05,87
Why would I go anywhere with you?

372
00:20:06,62 --> 00:20:09,25
Don't you want to fight
these bastards for real?

373
00:20:10,50 --> 00:20:12,50


374
00:20:16,91 --> 00:20:18,66
Go. Go! Go! Go on!

375
00:20:20,04 --> 00:20:21,45


376
00:20:27,70 --> 00:20:29,04


377
00:20:32,70 --> 00:20:34,12
MAN: Grab it. Let's go.

378
00:20:37,79 --> 00:20:40,04


379
00:20:40,12 --> 00:20:41,20



380
00:20:42,79 --> 00:20:43,87


381
00:20:43,95 --> 00:20:45,41
What does that mean?

382
00:20:45,50 --> 00:20:49,25
WORKER: It's a signal. Let's go!
Come on. Let's move.

383
00:20:49,33 --> 00:20:50,33


384
00:20:52,70 --> 00:20:53,87
What is all this?

385
00:20:53,95 --> 00:20:55,16
Intimidation, sir.

386
00:20:55,95 --> 00:20:57,25
Bluff and bluster.

387
00:21:04,33 --> 00:21:05,91


388
00:21:06,70 --> 00:21:08,04
How did you get here?

389
00:21:08,12 --> 00:21:10,00
I have a ship near the ferry lot.

390
00:21:10,08 --> 00:21:12,33
Maybe you are the Imperial spy.

391
00:21:12,41 --> 00:21:13,50
To what purpose?

392
00:21:14,08 --> 00:21:17,95
If you knew they were coming for me,
why would you be here now?

393
00:21:18,04 --> 00:21:22,04
Special people are hard to find. I didn't
want to see you tossed on the pyre.

394
00:21:22,12 --> 00:21:24,91
I thought there was time to figure it out,
but I was wrong.

395
00:21:25,00 --> 00:21:27,33


396
00:21:28,50 --> 00:21:30,08
-May I?


397
00:21:30,16 --> 00:21:32,54
I'm the only decent bet
you've got right now.

398
00:21:32,62 --> 00:21:34,33
You want to die being careful?

399
00:21:34,41 --> 00:21:35,41


400
00:21:37,83 --> 00:21:38,83


401
00:21:38,91 --> 00:21:40,87
-Are you carrying a comlink?
-Why?

402
00:21:40,95 --> 00:21:42,33
Give it. Give it to me now.

403
00:21:43,08 --> 00:21:44,08
Give it!

404
00:21:47,33 --> 00:21:48,33



405
00:21:49,00 --> 00:21:52,75
Rule number one,
never carry anything you don't control.

406
00:21:52,83 --> 00:21:54,00


407
00:21:54,08 --> 00:21:55,16


408
00:21:56,04 --> 00:21:57,54


409
00:21:58,50 --> 00:21:59,66
 Hey! There!

410
00:22:00,83 --> 00:22:01,91
They're taking the doors.

411
00:22:03,75 --> 00:22:05,04
We're surrounded.

412
00:22:05,12 --> 00:22:06,62


413
00:22:07,37 --> 00:22:09,70
MAN: Come on. Get back here.

414
00:22:09,79 --> 00:22:11,79
-MAN 2: Hurry. Hurry.
-MAN: Close it up. Close it up.

415
00:22:12,66 --> 00:22:14,79

-You, stop!

416
00:22:14,87 --> 00:22:16,41
-I said stop!


417
00:22:17,12 --> 00:22:18,91
You look scared, girl.

418
00:22:19,00 --> 00:22:21,00
Not runnin' home, are we?

419
00:22:21,08 --> 00:22:22,70
SOLDIER 1: <i>West Team, this is East Team.</i>

420
00:22:22,79 --> 00:22:25,08
<i>We're in place at the factory.</i>
<i>Should we engage?</i>

421
00:22:25,16 --> 00:22:26,41
No. No.

422
00:22:26,50 --> 00:22:29,54
Wait for us. We'll be there soon enough.
Hold the perimeter.

423
00:22:29,62 --> 00:22:31,66
They've got him pinned down, sir.

424
00:22:31,75 --> 00:22:33,33
Time to close the snare.

425
00:22:33,41 --> 00:22:35,33
 What are they waiting for?

426
00:22:35,41 --> 00:22:36,79
Reinforcements.

427
00:22:38,66 --> 00:22:40,37
How were you getting out of here?

428
00:22:40,45 --> 00:22:41,83
CASSIAN: My plan's gone.

429
00:22:41,91 --> 00:22:44,08
And your ride is 40 klicks
across the Wastelands.

430
00:22:44,16 --> 00:22:46,37
We just need a speeder.
What's our best option?

431
00:22:46,45 --> 00:22:48,00
West. Into town.

432
00:22:48,08 --> 00:22:49,50
Where does that go?

433
00:22:49,58 --> 00:22:51,75
-Under the old furnace.
-Does it get us out of here?

434
00:22:51,83 --> 00:22:53,70
CASSIAN: Yeah. It's the long way around.

435
00:22:54,41 --> 00:22:55,41


436
00:22:55,83 --> 00:22:56,83



437
00:22:57,75 --> 00:23:00,29
-CASSIAN: What is that?
-I put slap charges on the doors.

438
00:23:00,37 --> 00:23:01,87
What? When?

439
00:23:01,95 --> 00:23:04,29
Rule number two,
build your exit on your way in.

440
00:23:04,37 --> 00:23:05,41
Brace yourself.

441
00:23:05,50 --> 00:23:06,50


442
00:23:09,50 --> 00:23:10,50


443
00:23:12,25 --> 00:23:13,25


444
00:23:15,20 --> 00:23:16,54


445
00:23:22,20 --> 00:23:23,20


446
00:23:23,66 --> 00:23:24,66


447
00:23:25,58 --> 00:23:27,04
Let's go!

448
00:23:27,12 --> 00:23:29,41
-The box! We left the box!
-LUTHEN: No!

449
00:23:29,50 --> 00:23:31,08



450
00:23:31,16 --> 00:23:32,25
SOLDIER 1: There he is!

451
00:23:32,33 --> 00:23:33,79



452
00:23:35,70 --> 00:23:38,12


453
00:23:40,25 --> 00:23:41,54


454
00:23:45,25 --> 00:23:46,66
LUTHEN: Get down!

455
00:23:47,45 --> 00:23:48,83



456
00:23:49,87 --> 00:23:52,33
-CASSIAN: I'm going. Cover me!
-LUTHEN: Forget the box!

457
00:23:55,12 --> 00:23:56,12


458
00:23:59,75 --> 00:24:00,75


459
00:24:01,00 --> 00:24:03,54


460
00:24:03,62 --> 00:24:05,33
SOLDIER 6: <i>We're taking heavy fire.</i>

461
00:24:05,41 --> 00:24:06,87
I told you to wait!

462
00:24:06,95 --> 00:24:08,45
SOLDIER 6: <i>We've got two men down.</i>

463
00:24:09,00 --> 00:24:10,41
East Team, repeat last.

464
00:24:11,29 --> 00:24:12,54
East Team, repeat last.

465
00:24:24,37 --> 00:24:25,37


466
00:24:28,00 --> 00:24:29,00


467
00:24:29,37 --> 00:24:30,75
Come on!

468
00:24:31,08 --> 00:24:32,08


469
00:24:32,75 --> 00:24:33,75


470
00:24:34,20 --> 00:24:35,20


471
00:24:37,16 --> 00:24:38,16


472
00:24:38,66 --> 00:24:39,66


473
00:24:40,37 --> 00:24:41,37


474
00:24:44,87 --> 00:24:46,16


475
00:24:48,58 --> 00:24:49,62
CASSIAN: Look out!

476
00:24:49,70 --> 00:24:50,70


477
00:24:50,79 --> 00:24:52,16


478
00:24:54,08 --> 00:24:55,08


479
00:24:57,91 --> 00:24:58,91


480
00:25:00,70 --> 00:25:02,08


481
00:25:07,79 --> 00:25:08,83
Now! Come!

482
00:25:10,16 --> 00:25:11,16


483
00:25:11,25 --> 00:25:12,58



484
00:25:12,66 --> 00:25:13,75


485
00:25:15,95 --> 00:25:16,95
SERGEANT MOSK: East Team!

486
00:25:17,58 --> 00:25:19,00
What's goin' on up there?

487
00:25:20,45 --> 00:25:21,79
North Team, where are you?

488
00:25:22,70 --> 00:25:24,00
There's no signs.

489
00:25:24,08 --> 00:25:25,54
I don't know what street.

490
00:25:25,62 --> 00:25:27,29
SERGEANT MOSK: <i>We're in a firefight here.</i>

491
00:25:27,37 --> 00:25:29,20
<i>I need your exact position.</i>

492
00:25:29,29 --> 00:25:30,33


493
00:25:30,66 --> 00:25:32,37
-Told you to wait here!


494
00:25:32,45 --> 00:25:33,58


495
00:25:39,83 --> 00:25:41,37
CASSIAN: Wait! The box!

496
00:25:41,45 --> 00:25:42,91
The box is just sitting back there.

497
00:25:43,00 --> 00:25:44,08
I thought you were smart.

498
00:25:44,16 --> 00:25:45,66
What if it's just one guy left?

499
00:25:45,75 --> 00:25:47,70
They wouldn't come here
with only four men.

500
00:25:51,33 --> 00:25:53,95
We're on North Stairs Lane.
North Stairs Lane.

501
00:25:54,04 --> 00:25:55,04
Leave her!

502
00:25:55,12 --> 00:25:58,00
SERGEANT MOSK: <i>Get your men to Rix Road</i>
<i>and put a tac pod in air immediately.</i>

503
00:25:58,08 --> 00:26:00,33
Bix! Bix!

504
00:26:00,41 --> 00:26:02,91
-What have you done to her?
-You stop right there.

505
00:26:03,00 --> 00:26:05,16
-She's bleeding!
-I'm telling you to stop.

506
00:26:05,25 --> 00:26:06,83
SERGEANT MOSK: <i>North Team, sitrep.</i>

507
00:26:06,91 --> 00:26:08,37
Who did this?

508
00:26:08,75 --> 00:26:09,75


509
00:26:09,83 --> 00:26:10,91


510
00:26:11,62 --> 00:26:12,95
 Timm!

511
00:26:14,29 --> 00:26:16,16
-SERGEANT MOSK: <i>North Team, sitrep.</i>


512
00:26:16,25 --> 00:26:17,87
<i>What's going on up there?</i>

513
00:26:17,95 --> 00:26:19,79
<i>I need eyes in the air now!</i>

514
00:26:20,29 --> 00:26:22,04
SOLDIER 2: Acknowledged, sir. Stand by.

515
00:26:23,00 --> 00:26:24,37
Give me the rifle!

516
00:26:24,45 --> 00:26:25,45
Why?

517
00:26:25,54 --> 00:26:27,50
You're going back to the pod!

518
00:26:27,58 --> 00:26:29,04
By myself?

519
00:26:29,12 --> 00:26:31,50
Get the pod in the air.
Keep your radio on.

520
00:26:31,58 --> 00:26:32,58
Get moving!

521
00:26:32,66 --> 00:26:33,66


522
00:26:34,58 --> 00:26:35,66
Let's get out of here.

523
00:26:36,41 --> 00:26:37,95
North Team heading for Rix Road.

524
00:26:38,04 --> 00:26:39,95
Air support en route.

525
00:26:40,04 --> 00:26:41,20


526
00:26:41,62 --> 00:26:42,66
Timm.

527
00:26:44,58 --> 00:26:45,83
SERGEANT MOSK: Now it's three men?

528
00:26:45,91 --> 00:26:47,16
How is that possible?

529
00:26:47,25 --> 00:26:48,79
They brought the building down. 

530
00:26:48,87 --> 00:26:50,41
They've got explosives.

531
00:26:50,50 --> 00:26:52,62
Wait. Hold on. Hold on.
What do you mean "they"?

532
00:26:52,70 --> 00:26:54,12
SOLDIER 1: <i>There's two of them.</i>

533
00:26:54,20 --> 00:26:56,33
<i>Two humans. Heavily armed.</i>

534
00:26:56,41 --> 00:26:58,95
<i>-Heading your way.</i>
-SERGEANT MOSK: Keep 'em flanked.

535
00:26:59,04 --> 00:27:01,29
Keep pushing. Keep the channel open.

536
00:27:01,37 --> 00:27:03,12
-Now there's two of 'em?
-Apparently so.

537
00:27:03,20 --> 00:27:04,95
We're just gonna stand here?

538
00:27:05,04 --> 00:27:06,50


539
00:27:06,58 --> 00:27:07,66
Point taken.

540
00:27:09,00 --> 00:27:13,70
We'll split up, take positions,
pick 'em off when they come through.

541
00:27:13,79 --> 00:27:15,87
Rifle! Let's go!

542
00:27:15,95 --> 00:27:17,50
Left flank! Right flank!

543
00:27:18,37 --> 00:27:20,66


544
00:27:22,29 --> 00:27:23,62
SOLDIER: Take positions.

545
00:27:23,70 --> 00:27:25,25


546
00:27:31,20 --> 00:27:32,45


547
00:27:34,29 --> 00:27:35,75



548
00:27:36,79 --> 00:27:37,79
Hello?

549
00:27:39,00 --> 00:27:40,00
Hello?

550
00:27:41,12 --> 00:27:42,33


551
00:27:42,45 --> 00:27:45,12



552
00:27:45,20 --> 00:27:48,58


553
00:27:48,66 --> 00:27:50,50



554
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:01,37
Gets to you, doesn't it?

555
00:28:02,29 --> 00:28:03,37
SOLDIER 7: Shut it.

556
00:28:03,45 --> 00:28:04,45


557
00:28:05,70 --> 00:28:07,87
That's what a reckoning sounds like.

558
00:28:11,87 --> 00:28:14,20


559
00:28:15,00 --> 00:28:17,54


560
00:28:19,00 --> 00:28:21,87
You want it to stop,
but it just keeps coming.

561
00:28:21,95 --> 00:28:23,41
SOLDIER 7: I told you to shut up!

562
00:28:27,58 --> 00:28:28,58


563
00:28:32,95 --> 00:28:34,29
MAARVA: <i>It's when it stops,</i>

564
00:28:36,54 --> 00:28:38,83
that's when you'll really want
to start to fret.

565
00:28:40,33 --> 00:28:41,50
Why?

566
00:28:41,58 --> 00:28:42,70
What happens then?

567
00:28:42,79 --> 00:28:45,33


568
00:28:47,83 --> 00:28:49,04
 Hmm.

569
00:28:51,75 --> 00:28:53,20
Clear!

570
00:28:54,54 --> 00:28:55,54
Go! Go! Go!

571
00:28:57,37 --> 00:28:59,04
SERGEANT MOSK: 
<i>North Team, status?</i>

572
00:28:59,12 --> 00:29:00,45
In position.

573
00:29:01,08 --> 00:29:02,66
SERGEANT MOSK: <i>Eyes open, lads.</i>

574
00:29:02,75 --> 00:29:03,91
<i>Weapons ready.</i>

575
00:29:04,00 --> 00:29:06,00



576
00:29:07,25 --> 00:29:08,58


577
00:29:08,66 --> 00:29:10,37


578
00:29:19,87 --> 00:29:21,04


579
00:29:21,12 --> 00:29:22,54


580
00:29:35,12 --> 00:29:36,37


581
00:29:39,58 --> 00:29:40,70
Drop the weapon.

582
00:29:40,79 --> 00:29:41,83


583
00:29:46,91 --> 00:29:48,16
Now take off the comm.

584
00:29:51,83 --> 00:29:52,83
Put it down.

585
00:29:56,08 --> 00:29:57,08



586
00:29:57,66 --> 00:29:58,70
How many are you?

587
00:30:00,70 --> 00:30:01,79

LUTHEN: Which one do you want?

620
00:31:33,58 --> 00:31:36,00
