1
00:00:00,91 --> 00:00:04,62
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?

2
00:00:05,37 --> 00:00:07,20
What would we be stealing?

3
00:00:07,29 --> 00:00:10,91
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

4
00:00:13,33 --> 00:00:16,08
DEDRA: If I was them,
this is how I'd do it.

5
00:00:16,16 --> 00:00:17,41
I'd spread it out.

6
00:00:18,70 --> 00:00:20,91
Never climb the same fence twice.

7
00:00:21,04 --> 00:00:22,58

-TIMM: Bix!

8
00:00:22,66 --> 00:00:24,29
Who did this? 

9
00:00:25,29 --> 00:00:26,29
Timm!

10
00:00:26,37 --> 00:00:28,16
NEMIK: So you think it's hopeless, do you?

11
00:00:28,25 --> 00:00:30,37
Freedom? Independence?

12
00:00:30,45 --> 00:00:32,20
We should just submit and be thankful?

13
00:00:32,29 --> 00:00:34,50
Do I look thankful to you?

14
00:00:35,16 --> 00:00:37,29
-LIEUTENANT GORN: Corporal.
-At your service.

15
00:00:37,37 --> 00:00:38,70
Fall in.

16
00:00:38,79 --> 00:00:39,79
Turn.

17
00:00:41,16 --> 00:00:42,25
With me.

18
00:00:46,20 --> 00:00:47,45
Tell me you'll be all right.

19
00:00:47,54 --> 00:00:48,95
I'll be fine.

20
00:00:49,04 --> 00:00:50,37
Go.

21
00:00:50,45 --> 00:00:51,54


22
00:00:52,08 --> 00:00:54,79
Let's go!

23
00:00:54,87 --> 00:00:56,75
What is going on here?

24
00:00:57,33 --> 00:00:58,37


25
00:01:00,20 --> 00:01:01,79
-I'm pinned down!


26
00:01:03,83 --> 00:01:05,87

-No!

27
00:01:05,95 --> 00:01:07,12
Hang on!

28
00:01:07,20 --> 00:01:08,41


29
00:01:10,75 --> 00:01:11,75


30
00:01:13,04 --> 00:01:16,87
EEDY: My assumption is,
you have no prospect for the future.

31
00:01:16,95 --> 00:01:18,37
I'm calling Uncle Harlo.

32
00:01:18,45 --> 00:01:19,87
I'm calling in the family favor.

33
00:01:19,95 --> 00:01:21,79
You wanna guess how much is in there?

34
00:01:21,87 --> 00:01:24,45
Forty million a piece, give or take.

35
00:01:24,54 --> 00:01:27,54
-So no rebellion for you?
-Oh, I'm a rebel. It's just, uh...

36
00:01:28,45 --> 00:01:29,83
me against everybody else.

37
00:01:29,91 --> 00:01:30,91


38
00:01:31,00 --> 00:01:33,54
He wanted to take the money
and leave you here.

39
00:01:33,62 --> 00:01:35,95
-He wouldn't do that.
-I'm taking my cut.

40
00:01:36,04 --> 00:01:37,08
I did my job.

41
00:01:37,16 --> 00:01:39,20
I found someone I think can help me.

42
00:01:39,29 --> 00:01:40,37
We're vulnerable enough.

43
00:01:40,45 --> 00:01:42,16
We need funding, not more people.

44
00:01:42,25 --> 00:01:44,54
Don't lecture me on vulnerability.

45
00:01:44,62 --> 00:01:46,37
No one's more at risk than I am.

46
00:02:54,58 --> 00:02:55,62
EEDY: Syril?

47
00:02:57,45 --> 00:02:59,08
Syril!

48
00:03:00,54 --> 00:03:01,54


49
00:03:06,41 --> 00:03:07,70
Is that what you're wearing?

50
00:03:08,29 --> 00:03:09,87
SYRIL: It would seem so.

51
00:03:09,95 --> 00:03:12,12
What makes you believe
the Bureau of Standards

52
00:03:12,20 --> 00:03:14,16
is in the market for individuals?

53
00:03:15,04 --> 00:03:16,04
It's a brown suit.

54
00:03:16,79 --> 00:03:17,91
It's your interview.

55
00:03:18,00 --> 00:03:20,58
Perhaps, you would like to come along.

56
00:03:20,66 --> 00:03:21,79


57
00:03:21,87 --> 00:03:24,62
Uncle Harlo's influence
is not a thing to be trifled with.

58
00:03:24,70 --> 00:03:26,08
How am I trifling?

59
00:03:26,16 --> 00:03:28,37
He's done us a tremendous favor.

60
00:03:28,45 --> 00:03:31,91
You need to remember you're not just
representing yourself today.

61
00:03:33,16 --> 00:03:34,95
It's a brown suit. 

62
00:03:35,83 --> 00:03:37,04
The collar.

63
00:03:37,12 --> 00:03:39,04
-What about it?
-It's high.

64
00:03:39,91 --> 00:03:41,25
You've had it raised.

65
00:03:41,33 --> 00:03:42,62
I had it tailored.

66
00:03:43,37 --> 00:03:45,50
Everything says something, Syril.

67
00:03:45,58 --> 00:03:48,37
I've tried to make you understand that,
you've resisted.

68
00:03:48,83 --> 00:03:51,08
 What is it
that you hear my collar saying?

69
00:03:52,50 --> 00:03:53,66
"Look at me.

70
00:03:54,75 --> 00:03:56,41
"I don't believe in myself.

71
00:03:56,50 --> 00:03:58,75
"I am desperate for approval."

72
00:03:58,83 --> 00:04:01,04
MAN:  We have
distressing reports are reaching us

73
00:04:01,12 --> 00:04:02,79
that a terror attack and robbery

74
00:04:02,87 --> 00:04:06,04
have taken place
at the Imperial Armory on Aldhani,

75
00:04:06,12 --> 00:04:08,50
with multiple fatalities reported.

76
00:04:08,58 --> 00:04:09,66
What happened?

77
00:04:09,75 --> 00:04:11,66
-EEDY: Rabble.
-...a Blockade Order was issued...

78
00:04:11,75 --> 00:04:12,87
EEDY: They attacked a garrison.

79
00:04:12,95 --> 00:04:14,33
They'll regret it.

80
00:04:14,41 --> 00:04:16,95
MAN: ...officials on the scene
are still assessing the loss

81
00:04:17,04 --> 00:04:18,83
and searching for the conspirators.

82
00:04:19,45 --> 00:04:23,16
YULAREN: The criminals responsible
for last night's atrocity on Aldhani

83
00:04:23,25 --> 00:04:25,79
think they've taken
the Empire by surprise.

84
00:04:26,25 --> 00:04:27,45
We know better.

85
00:04:27,54 --> 00:04:29,83
We know the real shock will be

86
00:04:29,91 --> 00:04:34,87
when they discover how ready
and eager we are to respond,

87
00:04:34,95 --> 00:04:37,91
to be prepared, to be here this morning

88
00:04:38,00 --> 00:04:39,37
and know that the only question

89
00:04:39,45 --> 00:04:44,20
we need to answer
is how tight to close our fist.

90
00:04:45,25 --> 00:04:46,79
This is why we plan.

91
00:04:46,87 --> 00:04:50,70
This is why we work so hard
when we're at peace.

92
00:04:50,79 --> 00:04:56,54
This is why we recruit so carefully
and demand so much.

93
00:04:56,62 --> 00:05:01,62
The following measures
will be adopted Empire-wide as of today.

94
00:05:02,37 --> 00:05:07,33
A tribute tax equal to five times
the amount stolen from Aldhani

95
00:05:07,41 --> 00:05:11,12
will be levied on any sector
harboring partisan activity.

96
00:05:11,20 --> 00:05:16,25
We will make it clear
that no one steals from the Empire.

97
00:05:16,33 --> 00:05:23,25
The use of any local custom, festival,
or tradition as cover for rebel activity

98
00:05:24,66 --> 00:05:29,16
will trigger permanent revocation
of Imperial tolerance.

99
00:05:30,87 --> 00:05:33,54
I spoke with Emperor Palpatine last night,

100
00:05:35,08 --> 00:05:41,54
and he's assured me that the ISB
will be taking the lead going forward.

101
00:05:41,62 --> 00:05:43,16
No one in this room

102
00:05:43,25 --> 00:05:47,08
should have trouble accessing
Army or Naval resources in future.

103
00:05:48,83 --> 00:05:52,45
The Emperor will be convening
an emergency session of the Senate

104
00:05:52,54 --> 00:05:55,91
to propose a legislation package
of bills and amendments

105
00:05:56,00 --> 00:06:01,75
that will free our hands in all matters
of surveillance, search, and seizure.

106
00:06:02,54 --> 00:06:07,58
We will be invoking the Public Order
Resentencing Directive later today.

107
00:06:07,66 --> 00:06:10,41
P-O-R-D.

108
00:06:10,50 --> 00:06:16,00
Any criminal act,
with even indirect effect on the Empire,

109
00:06:16,08 --> 00:06:19,79
will henceforth be branded
a Class One Offense.

110
00:06:20,75 --> 00:06:24,62
All prison sentences
are immediately re-evaluated.

111
00:06:24,70 --> 00:06:28,58
All outstanding fines and levies
are to be paid in full.

112
00:06:28,66 --> 00:06:31,12
-I have assured the Emperor...
-HEERT: You're not pleased.

113
00:06:32,00 --> 00:06:34,04
DEDRA: We're playing
straight into their hands.

114
00:06:35,04 --> 00:06:36,83
-HEERT: Whose hands?
-The rebels.

115
00:06:37,79 --> 00:06:39,33
This is exactly what they want.

116
00:06:40,00 --> 00:06:42,62
We're treating what happened
at Aldhani like a robbery.

117
00:06:42,70 --> 00:06:44,20
HEERT: What would you call it?

118
00:06:45,79 --> 00:06:46,95
An announcement.

119
00:06:47,54 --> 00:06:49,75
MAN: 
Preliminary investigation puts the loss

120
00:06:49,83 --> 00:06:51,25
at over eighty million credits.

121
00:06:51,33 --> 00:06:54,29
All military personnel
at the garrison have been replaced

122
00:06:54,37 --> 00:06:56,66
and are being interrogated by ISB.

123
00:06:56,75 --> 00:06:58,66
ISB confirms the tracking devices

124
00:06:58,75 --> 00:07:02,25
in the escape craft were disabled
prior to it reaching hyperspace.

125
00:07:02,33 --> 00:07:06,04
134 Aldhani residents
have been taken into custody

126
00:07:06,12 --> 00:07:08,29
under suspicion
of abetting the terrorists.

127
00:07:08,37 --> 00:07:10,16


128
00:07:13,45 --> 00:07:14,66
Mon Mothma.

129
00:07:16,33 --> 00:07:17,41
Without warning?

130
00:07:18,25 --> 00:07:20,00
Wipe the smile off your face. 

131
00:07:22,95 --> 00:07:24,87


132
00:07:24,95 --> 00:07:26,37


133
00:07:29,45 --> 00:07:31,50
 I should've called.

134
00:07:31,58 --> 00:07:34,95
We're on our way to the Senate,
I realized we'd be passing by.

135
00:07:35,04 --> 00:07:36,50
-I'll be right back.
-KLORIS: Ma'am.

136
00:07:37,87 --> 00:07:40,20
Perrin likes it,
I'm just not sure he loves it.

137
00:07:40,29 --> 00:07:42,87
-Ah.
-I think I might want the other one.

138
00:07:47,20 --> 00:07:48,20


139
00:07:50,12 --> 00:07:51,16
Was this you?

140
00:07:52,25 --> 00:07:53,58
LUTHEN: What do you mean?

141
00:07:53,66 --> 00:07:55,33
 The garrison. Aldhani.

142
00:07:55,41 --> 00:07:57,45
Ah! Is it true?

143
00:07:57,54 --> 00:07:59,33
Kleya was just... 

144
00:07:59,41 --> 00:08:02,16
MON: 

145
00:08:02,29 --> 00:08:04,25
I've been worried
you might do something like this.

146
00:08:04,33 --> 00:08:05,95


147
00:08:06,04 --> 00:08:07,58
How I wish I had.

148
00:08:08,29 --> 00:08:09,50
Let's have a look.

149
00:08:15,12 --> 00:08:16,50
I don't believe you.

150
00:08:16,58 --> 00:08:19,20
-Well, you'll have to try harder.
-Don't you dare talk to me like that.

151
00:08:19,29 --> 00:08:21,20
Revolutions are expensive.

152
00:08:21,29 --> 00:08:23,04
I told you, I'm doing everything I can.

153
00:08:23,16 --> 00:08:25,87
 Your "everything"
seemed to be all about

154
00:08:25,95 --> 00:08:28,62
bringing in a savior
to access your family funds.

155
00:08:31,83 --> 00:08:33,16
 It was you, wasn't it?

156
00:08:35,20 --> 00:08:39,33
I explained to you the risk of new faces,
but you seemed to know better.

157
00:08:40,08 --> 00:08:42,66
 You realize what you've done?

158
00:08:43,33 --> 00:08:46,41
I thought you were here
to tell me about the meeting.

159
00:08:46,50 --> 00:08:47,54
It's tonight.

160
00:08:49,08 --> 00:08:50,41
They may reschedule.

161
00:08:53,54 --> 00:08:55,12
I warned you when we started.

162
00:08:55,20 --> 00:08:58,37
-You told me we were building a network.
-What were my words?

163
00:08:58,45 --> 00:09:00,08
This is something else entirely.

164
00:09:00,16 --> 00:09:02,33
LUTHEN: "Turning back will be impossible."

165
00:09:02,41 --> 00:09:04,25
You knew where this was going.

166
00:09:04,33 --> 00:09:05,41
You've always known.

167
00:09:07,37 --> 00:09:08,37


168
00:09:10,66 --> 00:09:13,04
Has anyone ever made a weapon
that wasn't used?

169
00:09:15,20 --> 00:09:17,25
The network's been built. It's up.

170
00:09:19,25 --> 00:09:20,75
It grows or it dies.

171
00:09:21,95 --> 00:09:23,54
 We've waited long enough.

172
00:09:23,62 --> 00:09:26,04
You realize what you've set in motion?

173
00:09:26,12 --> 00:09:27,54
LUTHEN: It was time for that as well.

174
00:09:27,62 --> 00:09:29,70
-Palpatine won't hesitate now.
-Exactly!

175
00:09:30,70 --> 00:09:31,70
We need it.

176
00:09:32,79 --> 00:09:33,83
We need the fear.

177
00:09:34,87 --> 00:09:37,58
-We need them to overreact.
-You can't be serious.

178
00:09:38,75 --> 00:09:42,45
The Empire has been choking us
so slowly, we're starting not to notice.

179
00:09:43,37 --> 00:09:45,33
The time has come to force their hand.

180
00:09:45,41 --> 00:09:46,83
People will suffer.

181
00:09:48,75 --> 00:09:50,04
That's the plan.

182
00:09:51,87 --> 00:09:53,16
You're not angry at me.

183
00:09:54,29 --> 00:09:56,41
I'm just saying out loud
what you already know.

184
00:09:57,37 --> 00:09:59,33
There will be no rules going forward.

185
00:10:00,29 --> 00:10:02,25
If you're not willing
to risk your conscience,

186
00:10:02,33 --> 00:10:04,20
then surrender and be done with it.

187
00:10:06,95 --> 00:10:07,95


188
00:10:10,16 --> 00:10:12,45
We need every credit
we can get our hands on.

189
00:10:13,70 --> 00:10:15,37
Let me know how the meeting goes.

190
00:10:15,45 --> 00:10:17,45


191
00:10:20,00 --> 00:10:23,00
I'm afraid I won't be taking
either of these pieces this morning.

192
00:10:23,12 --> 00:10:27,66
 I'll have some new things
coming in very, very soon.

193
00:10:27,75 --> 00:10:29,20
MON: I'll be sure to come by.

194
00:10:29,33 --> 00:10:31,91
LUTHEN: 
Always at your service, Senator.

195
00:10:32,00 --> 00:10:33,08
Always at your service.

196
00:10:36,70 --> 00:10:38,29
I hope she's worth it.

197
00:10:40,95 --> 00:10:42,62
LUTHEN: Well, we'll see, won't we?

198
00:10:45,79 --> 00:10:47,08
We can't hide forever.

199
00:10:48,41 --> 00:10:50,95


200
00:11:07,45 --> 00:11:11,04
People all think we're kidding
when we say it, but it's true.

201
00:11:11,12 --> 00:11:14,50
There are no small jobs
at the Bureau Of Standards.

202
00:11:15,70 --> 00:11:18,16
 I spoke with your uncle.

203
00:11:19,50 --> 00:11:23,12
Some sectors might naturally appear
more exciting from the outside.

204
00:11:23,83 --> 00:11:26,95
Weights and Gauges
may seem a more vibrant arena

205
00:11:27,04 --> 00:11:31,45
than Redundancy or Verification,
but walk the floor,

206
00:11:31,54 --> 00:11:35,95
talk to any lifetime employee,
you'll be surprised.

207
00:11:36,95 --> 00:11:37,95
I'm sure.

208
00:11:38,04 --> 00:11:39,79
Morlana One.

209
00:11:42,50 --> 00:11:44,66
SYRIL: Yes, uh... 

210
00:11:46,54 --> 00:11:48,41
There's a rebel murderer running free

211
00:11:48,50 --> 00:11:51,04
because of corruption and laxity
in the corporate authority.

212
00:11:51,12 --> 00:11:53,62
I was punished
for trying to uphold the law.

213
00:11:53,70 --> 00:11:55,87
Do my job. Maintain public safety.

214
00:11:58,12 --> 00:11:59,12
Two men dead.

215
00:11:59,75 --> 00:12:01,04
Co-workers.

216
00:12:02,20 --> 00:12:04,08
I believe that we have laws for a reason.

217
00:12:05,08 --> 00:12:08,08
I fully intend to clear my name
and have my record expunged.

218
00:12:10,62 --> 00:12:12,70
Why don't we start that process now?

219
00:12:12,79 --> 00:12:17,41
Probably best for everyone to just edit
this a bit before signing you in.

220
00:12:17,50 --> 00:12:19,33
-I'm sure your uncle would approve.


221
00:12:19,41 --> 00:12:20,62
Fresh start, eh?

222
00:12:20,70 --> 00:12:22,12
New beginnings.

223
00:12:22,20 --> 00:12:26,66
We just happen to have
an immediate opening in Fuel Purity.

224
00:12:27,41 --> 00:12:29,45
I'd hate to see you miss your chance.

225
00:12:30,45 --> 00:12:33,04


226
00:12:33,70 --> 00:12:36,87


227
00:12:40,33 --> 00:12:42,50
MAN: 
Exit right for the Senate level.

228
00:12:42,58 --> 00:12:44,50


229
00:12:44,58 --> 00:12:48,54
Exit left for the downtown, midtown level.

230
00:12:49,87 --> 00:12:51,95


231
00:12:53,08 --> 00:12:54,54
STORMTROOPER: Four-nine vector six.

232
00:12:55,62 --> 00:12:58,16
L-U-H-three-four-one.

233
00:12:58,25 --> 00:12:59,33
Security clearance code...

234
00:13:18,41 --> 00:13:21,58
-MAN: The food is superb.
-WOMAN: It's quite exquisite...

235
00:13:43,33 --> 00:13:44,95


236
00:13:45,04 --> 00:13:47,75
-DEDRA: At ease, Attendant.
 Yes, sir.

237
00:13:47,83 --> 00:13:49,66
Ma'am. Sir.

238
00:13:49,75 --> 00:13:51,16
Your tunic.

239
00:13:51,25 --> 00:13:53,62
Sorry, sir. Ma'am.

240
00:13:54,33 --> 00:13:55,41
Sorry.

241
00:13:55,50 --> 00:13:56,66
What is your name?

242
00:13:57,37 --> 00:13:58,66
Felzonis.

243
00:13:58,75 --> 00:14:00,16
Attendant Felzonis.

244
00:14:00,87 --> 00:14:04,70
Hmm. I need a Multi-Sector Data Blend
going back two years.

245
00:14:04,79 --> 00:14:07,79
The survey pool is Imperial Naval bases
and repair facilities.

246
00:14:08,54 --> 00:14:12,70
I want a record of all missing avionics,
comm, navigation, and targeting equipment.

247
00:14:13,45 --> 00:14:14,66
For which star system?

248
00:14:14,75 --> 00:14:16,00
All star systems.

249
00:14:17,66 --> 00:14:19,12
Is that a problem?

250
00:14:20,33 --> 00:14:25,08
I'll need this report kept confidential
and a copy sent exclusively to my office.

251
00:14:25,16 --> 00:14:27,91
Can I rely on you
for that level of discretion?

252
00:14:28,00 --> 00:14:29,50
Absolutely.

253
00:14:29,58 --> 00:14:31,41
Yes. Can do.

254
00:14:31,50 --> 00:14:32,58
Will do.

255
00:14:34,37 --> 00:14:35,41
Will do.

256
00:14:37,25 --> 00:14:39,50
Right. Get on with it.

257
00:14:42,04 --> 00:14:44,37


258
00:14:52,29 --> 00:14:53,29


259
00:14:56,00 --> 00:14:58,58


260
00:15:00,20 --> 00:15:01,45


261
00:15:29,66 --> 00:15:30,75
Where is he?

262
00:15:32,33 --> 00:15:33,58
I shouldn't even be here.

263
00:15:34,91 --> 00:15:36,00
Neither of us should.

264
00:15:37,00 --> 00:15:38,12
The money's safe.

265
00:15:38,83 --> 00:15:39,95
We know.

266
00:15:40,04 --> 00:15:42,87
It's been moved already.
You've done exceptional work.

267
00:15:42,95 --> 00:15:45,08
It's the trawler
that we're more worried about.

268
00:15:45,79 --> 00:15:47,08
It's buried. Gone for good.

269
00:15:47,16 --> 00:15:49,25
-You're sure?
-Yes.

270
00:15:52,20 --> 00:15:53,41
He read your message.

271
00:15:54,33 --> 00:15:55,50


272
00:15:56,04 --> 00:15:57,66
I really thought he'd be here.

273
00:15:59,12 --> 00:16:00,62
Every loss is different.

274
00:16:00,70 --> 00:16:01,83
Every one's the same.

275
00:16:01,91 --> 00:16:03,66
I recruited Taramyn myself.

276
00:16:04,29 --> 00:16:06,29
Nemik, Gorn, they'll all be remembered.

277
00:16:08,41 --> 00:16:09,83
That's it?

278
00:16:09,91 --> 00:16:11,58
He had doubts about Skeen.

279
00:16:11,66 --> 00:16:13,45
It's one less thing to worry about.

280
00:16:15,29 --> 00:16:16,62
Have you heard from Cinta?

281
00:16:17,91 --> 00:16:19,91
She's doing what she was told.

282
00:16:21,20 --> 00:16:23,83
Receiving messages
is just as dangerous as sending them.

283
00:16:23,91 --> 00:16:25,37
You should keep that in mind.

284
00:16:27,00 --> 00:16:28,16
We have a loose end.

285
00:16:28,95 --> 00:16:31,83
Cassian Andor, who you know as Clem.

286
00:16:32,95 --> 00:16:34,08
You need to find him.

287
00:16:34,75 --> 00:16:35,79
Find him?

288
00:16:36,70 --> 00:16:39,33
We can't have him walking around
with Luthen in his head.

289
00:16:40,66 --> 00:16:41,66
You mean kill him.

290
00:16:41,75 --> 00:16:45,16
This is what revolution looks like, Vel.

291
00:16:45,25 --> 00:16:46,58


292
00:16:47,70 --> 00:16:49,45
We'll send you what we have on him.

293
00:16:53,91 --> 00:16:55,25


294
00:17:23,08 --> 00:17:24,29


295
00:17:24,37 --> 00:17:26,45

-MAARVA:  Who's there?

296
00:17:26,54 --> 00:17:28,12
-I hear you!


297
00:17:28,54 --> 00:17:29,75


298
00:17:29,83 --> 00:17:32,04
MAARVA: Just, just hold on!

299
00:17:32,70 --> 00:17:35,08


300
00:17:36,66 --> 00:17:38,66
-B2EMO: Cassian.
-Oh! Get in here. 

301
00:17:38,75 --> 00:17:40,75
-Since when do we lock the door?
-Oh!

302
00:17:40,83 --> 00:17:42,12
B2EMO: Where have you been?

303
00:17:42,20 --> 00:17:45,08
Look at you. 

304
00:17:50,54 --> 00:17:51,79


305
00:17:52,79 --> 00:17:55,37
You can't stay here, Cass. It's not safe.

306
00:17:55,45 --> 00:17:57,20
B2EMO: There is t-t-troopers now.

307
00:17:57,29 --> 00:18:00,04
-CASSIAN: That was fast.
-Yeah, they came the next day.

308
00:18:00,95 --> 00:18:03,58
Kicked out Pre-Mor, took over the hotel.

309
00:18:03,66 --> 00:18:05,87
Ferrix is under Imperial authority.

310
00:18:07,45 --> 00:18:08,75


311
00:18:09,45 --> 00:18:11,45
You shouldn't be here. 

312
00:18:12,41 --> 00:18:13,75
Someone turned me in.

313
00:18:14,70 --> 00:18:15,79
You don't know?

314
00:18:17,16 --> 00:18:18,41
Know what?

315
00:18:18,50 --> 00:18:20,41
-B2EMO: T-T-Timm.
-What?

316
00:18:20,50 --> 00:18:22,16
Timm Karlo turned you in.

317
00:18:23,58 --> 00:18:25,95
No point in stewing over it,
he's dead now.

318
00:18:26,04 --> 00:18:28,37
The Corpos killed him
when they were coming after you.

319
00:18:28,45 --> 00:18:29,75
How do you know all this?

320
00:18:29,83 --> 00:18:31,08
Everyone knows it.

321
00:18:31,16 --> 00:18:32,62
-Bix knew about it?
-No.

322
00:18:32,70 --> 00:18:35,41
She was coming to warn you,
and Timm was trying to stop her,

323
00:18:35,50 --> 00:18:37,87
or to catch her, I don't know.
I've... I've heard both.

324
00:18:37,95 --> 00:18:40,16
But you can't be here, Cass.

325
00:18:41,62 --> 00:18:43,79
The Imperials are here to stay.

326
00:18:43,87 --> 00:18:45,79
They're not going away this time.

327
00:18:46,45 --> 00:18:48,12
It's all come undone.

328
00:18:48,20 --> 00:18:50,20
We won't have to worry about that.

329
00:18:50,91 --> 00:18:52,12
What are you talking about?

330
00:18:52,91 --> 00:18:54,08
We're getting out of here.

331
00:18:54,91 --> 00:18:55,91
We're leaving.

332
00:18:56,91 --> 00:18:57,91
To go where?

333
00:18:58,00 --> 00:18:59,41
Anywhere we want.

334
00:19:00,33 --> 00:19:02,45
 I got lucky.

335
00:19:03,37 --> 00:19:04,70
I scored.

336
00:19:04,79 --> 00:19:07,58
I've got enough credits
to get us anywhere.

337
00:19:08,58 --> 00:19:09,95
We're gonna clear out.

338
00:19:10,04 --> 00:19:11,95
Leave this mess behind.

339
00:19:12,04 --> 00:19:13,79
B2EMO: When d-d-do we go?

340
00:19:13,87 --> 00:19:15,58
-We go tonight.
-Tonight?

341
00:19:15,66 --> 00:19:16,79
Yeah, why not?

342
00:19:16,87 --> 00:19:18,87
What do we need to take
but the three of us?

343
00:19:19,00 --> 00:19:21,45

-Huh? Get out of the cold and damp.

344
00:19:21,54 --> 00:19:24,20
Find somewhere warm and easy.

345
00:19:24,29 --> 00:19:25,50
I can make it happen.

346
00:19:27,54 --> 00:19:29,08
It's all gonna be different now, Ma.

347
00:19:29,16 --> 00:19:31,33


348
00:19:34,12 --> 00:19:35,16


349
00:19:35,87 --> 00:19:36,95


350
00:19:37,41 --> 00:19:38,41



351
00:19:38,50 --> 00:19:39,50
CASSIAN: What's wrong?

352
00:19:40,45 --> 00:19:41,83
MAARVA: Just such a lot to take in.

353
00:19:43,37 --> 00:19:44,62
No one knows I'm here.

354
00:19:45,54 --> 00:19:48,58
We take what we can carry,
and we disappear.

355
00:19:48,66 --> 00:19:53,00
It's just such a big idea,
you know, I... I get so tired.

356
00:19:54,00 --> 00:19:56,62
You surprised me. 

357
00:19:56,70 --> 00:19:59,79
 What am I thinking?
It's... It's late.

358
00:19:59,87 --> 00:20:02,29
Yeah, yeah. You... You gotta rest.

359
00:20:02,37 --> 00:20:06,04
I'll check up on Bix, and we'll pull out
first thing in the morning.

360
00:20:06,79 --> 00:20:08,37
-All right?
-B2EMO: F-F-First thing.

361
00:20:10,41 --> 00:20:12,08
-Let's do that.
-Ah.

362
00:20:13,33 --> 00:20:15,20


363
00:20:19,12 --> 00:20:20,12
Thank you.

364
00:20:28,83 --> 00:20:30,33
Sorry we're not having dinner.

365
00:20:31,37 --> 00:20:32,87
How long are you staying?

366
00:20:32,95 --> 00:20:34,83
I'm back to Chandrila tomorrow.

367
00:20:34,91 --> 00:20:36,62
I haven't been home all year.

368
00:20:36,70 --> 00:20:38,16
You haven't missed much.

369
00:20:38,25 --> 00:20:39,29
I've missed you.

370
00:20:39,37 --> 00:20:41,37
You always seem to be away when I'm there.

371
00:20:41,45 --> 00:20:42,95
I'm not that hard to find, Mon.

372
00:20:43,04 --> 00:20:44,04
Not for a Senator.

373
00:20:44,83 --> 00:20:45,83
You're right.

374
00:20:45,91 --> 00:20:47,95
-I've been a poor friend.
-No, that's not what I meant.

375
00:20:48,62 --> 00:20:50,95
Life takes us where it will.

376
00:20:51,91 --> 00:20:54,08
You've become all this. All these years.

377
00:20:55,16 --> 00:20:57,37
We're both a long way
from where we started.

378
00:20:58,37 --> 00:20:59,58
MON: Have I changed so much?

379
00:21:00,16 --> 00:21:03,04
-We've all had to adapt.
-Is it that bad?

380
00:21:03,54 --> 00:21:06,16

I just can't imagine living here, Mon.

381
00:21:06,25 --> 00:21:07,25
Like this.

382
00:21:08,00 --> 00:21:09,08
Coruscant.

383
00:21:09,16 --> 00:21:10,62
No escape.

384
00:21:10,70 --> 00:21:13,91
Just this glimpse of what it's like here,
what you have to do.

385
00:21:14,70 --> 00:21:15,87
It can be challenging.

386
00:21:15,95 --> 00:21:17,50
You carry it gracefully.

387
00:21:19,75 --> 00:21:20,83
Can I trust you, Tay?

388
00:21:21,66 --> 00:21:26,66
Can I call back our old kinship
and share some truth with you?

389
00:21:26,75 --> 00:21:27,75
LEIDA: Mother.

390
00:21:28,91 --> 00:21:30,00
Leida.

391
00:21:30,08 --> 00:21:32,25
-Do you remember my daughter?
-Of course.

392
00:21:33,62 --> 00:21:37,37
This is Tay Kolma,
one of my oldest friends.

393
00:21:37,45 --> 00:21:38,62
How do you do?

394
00:21:38,70 --> 00:21:39,87
You've met before.

395
00:21:39,95 --> 00:21:42,62
Bank Of Kolma?
You know Adrine and Marsa from back home.

396
00:21:42,70 --> 00:21:45,00
-My sisters.
-Um, I'm not sure.

397
00:21:45,08 --> 00:21:47,00
It's been a long time,
and you've certainly grown up.

398
00:21:47,08 --> 00:21:48,70

-So everyone says.

399
00:21:48,79 --> 00:21:51,04
Typical banker.
No one pays me to be original.

400
00:21:51,12 --> 00:21:54,79
Oh. Father said I needed to ask you
if I may be excused.

401
00:21:55,91 --> 00:21:56,91
Yes.

402
00:21:57,91 --> 00:21:58,91
You're excused.

403
00:21:59,00 --> 00:22:02,33
-TAY: Lovely seeing you again.
-LEIDA: Uh, yes. Have fun, Mother.

404
00:22:07,58 --> 00:22:09,29
Another part of the challenge.

405
00:22:09,37 --> 00:22:10,37
It's a difficult age.

406
00:22:12,20 --> 00:22:17,16
I've spent a great deal of time
thinking about this conversation, Tay.

407
00:22:19,16 --> 00:22:21,29
I want to tell you something

408
00:22:21,37 --> 00:22:25,70
that only three people
in the galaxy know about.

409
00:22:28,25 --> 00:22:29,75
Why would you want to do that?

410
00:22:30,66 --> 00:22:31,95
Because I need your help.

411
00:22:32,83 --> 00:22:34,70
And I'm hoping I can trust you.

412
00:22:36,41 --> 00:22:38,25
Is this personal or political?

413
00:22:38,95 --> 00:22:40,04
Political.

414
00:22:40,12 --> 00:22:42,25
-Then I'd suggest you hesitate.
-Why?

415
00:22:43,87 --> 00:22:45,66
TAY: Like I said, we've both changed.

416
00:22:47,58 --> 00:22:50,79
I've done more
than grow weary of the Empire.

417
00:22:51,70 --> 00:22:54,79
I'm afraid you'd find my politics
a bit strong for your taste.

418
00:22:55,87 --> 00:22:58,62
Your world is inescapably
linked to the Empire.

419
00:22:58,70 --> 00:23:00,62
You're with these people all the time.

420
00:23:01,50 --> 00:23:04,12
 I'm not sure
you're aware how far afield

421
00:23:04,20 --> 00:23:07,20
some of us have taken
our political allegiances these days.

422
00:23:07,33 --> 00:23:09,70


423
00:23:09,79 --> 00:23:12,54
Sorry, I think I've had too much
of Perrin's Embassy punch.

424
00:23:12,62 --> 00:23:15,16
 Drink up.

425
00:23:16,16 --> 00:23:19,16
Drink up, Tay, and keep smiling

426
00:23:19,25 --> 00:23:24,33
 as if we're having
a happy chat about childhood days.

427
00:23:24,41 --> 00:23:27,04
I'm not sure I understand.

428
00:23:27,83 --> 00:23:30,16
No, you don't.

429
00:23:31,75 --> 00:23:37,25
What you see, what people say about me,
it's a clear picture, isn't it?

430
00:23:37,33 --> 00:23:40,37
I'm a polite, sometimes-indecisive Senator

431
00:23:40,45 --> 00:23:43,87
who spends her days fighting and failing
to protect Separatist do-gooders

432
00:23:44,83 --> 00:23:46,50
and battle Empire overreach.

433
00:23:47,29 --> 00:23:51,04
An irritation, as you so harshly put it.

434
00:23:51,12 --> 00:23:53,79
-I've made you angry, I...
-No, no. You've set me free.

435
00:23:55,04 --> 00:23:58,62
I've been wondering all day
how I could be sure of confiding in you.

436
00:23:58,70 --> 00:24:00,75
I don't know what we're talking about.

437
00:24:02,20 --> 00:24:03,25
It's a lie.

438
00:24:04,87 --> 00:24:09,12
The Mon Mothma
people think they know, it's a lie.

439
00:24:09,20 --> 00:24:10,29
It's a projection.

440
00:24:10,37 --> 00:24:11,41
It's a front.

441
00:24:13,87 --> 00:24:15,62
Smile. 

442
00:24:17,00 --> 00:24:18,87
I've learned from Palpatine.

443
00:24:18,95 --> 00:24:22,50
I show you the stone in my hand,
you miss the knife at your throat.

444
00:24:24,41 --> 00:24:26,62
Where is this going, Mon?

445
00:24:32,12 --> 00:24:35,83
The Grand Vizier has infiltrated
my Separatist Coalition meetings.

446
00:24:36,66 --> 00:24:41,41
My driver is an ISB plant and reports
on my secret humanitarian programs.

447
00:24:42,66 --> 00:24:45,50
They know they watch me, and I want that,

448
00:24:46,37 --> 00:24:49,29
because as long as everyone
thinks I'm an irritation,

449
00:24:49,37 --> 00:24:52,00
there's a good chance
they'll miss what I'm really doing.

450
00:24:52,08 --> 00:24:53,87
What are you really doing?

451
00:24:53,95 --> 00:24:55,29
Raising money.

452
00:24:56,62 --> 00:24:59,41
I need to access my family accounts.
Until recently,

453
00:24:59,50 --> 00:25:02,66
I was able to dip in and out of
my family fortune without concern.

454
00:25:02,79 --> 00:25:05,45
 That's changed.

455
00:25:07,29 --> 00:25:08,29
I need help.

456
00:25:09,20 --> 00:25:10,70
Raising money for what?

457
00:25:12,00 --> 00:25:14,41
I'm forming a Chandrilan
charitable outreach program.

458
00:25:15,08 --> 00:25:16,58
I'll ask you to be chairman.

459
00:25:16,66 --> 00:25:18,91
It will involve visits here to Coruscant.

460
00:25:19,95 --> 00:25:24,75
It will appear to be another
of my benevolent and useless irritations.

461
00:25:28,41 --> 00:25:30,41

I've explored the alternatives.

462
00:25:30,50 --> 00:25:31,50
You're my best shot.

463
00:25:31,58 --> 00:25:33,04
You haven't answered my question.

464
00:25:33,12 --> 00:25:34,12
And I won't.

465
00:25:34,75 --> 00:25:36,29
You're better off not knowing.

466
00:25:37,37 --> 00:25:40,54
Or perhaps, you'd find my politics
a bit strong for your taste.

467
00:25:44,00 --> 00:25:45,58
Perrin's on his way over.

468
00:25:45,66 --> 00:25:48,08
He knows none of this.
He's not to be trusted.

469
00:25:50,04 --> 00:25:51,08
Smile.

470
00:25:51,16 --> 00:25:52,75
There you are.

471
00:25:52,83 --> 00:25:54,79
Reminiscing, are we? School days?

472
00:25:54,87 --> 00:25:56,37
-Are we that predictable?


473
00:25:56,45 --> 00:25:59,12
-There's a reunion coming up.
-Oh, don't remind me. 

474
00:25:59,20 --> 00:26:02,45
She pretends not to care,
but we both know better, don't we?

475
00:26:02,54 --> 00:26:03,75
It was ever thus.

476
00:26:03,83 --> 00:26:07,12
May I steal her back? There's a few guests
that require special handling.

477
00:26:07,20 --> 00:26:08,33
Of course.

478
00:26:08,41 --> 00:26:09,83
To be continued.

479
00:26:20,29 --> 00:26:23,08


480
00:26:27,25 --> 00:26:29,50


481
00:26:41,29 --> 00:26:42,79


482
00:26:45,83 --> 00:26:47,29


483
00:26:58,70 --> 00:27:00,12


484
00:27:01,58 --> 00:27:02,66
Hey.

485
00:27:05,08 --> 00:27:06,08
BIX:  Cass?

486
00:27:06,75 --> 00:27:07,75
Hey.

487
00:27:09,04 --> 00:27:10,37
What are you doing here?

488
00:27:16,25 --> 00:27:20,16
Remember when your father caught me
climbing over that wall?

489
00:27:20,25 --> 00:27:21,91
This is the last place you should be.

490
00:27:22,00 --> 00:27:23,79


491
00:27:24,54 --> 00:27:27,62
I think those
were his exact words. 

492
00:27:27,79 --> 00:27:29,25
It's not safe here.

493
00:27:33,91 --> 00:27:34,91
Timm?

494
00:27:36,08 --> 00:27:38,62
I guess he thought
you and I were back together.

495
00:27:39,87 --> 00:27:41,41
Why would he think that?

496
00:27:41,50 --> 00:27:43,37
You can't be as surprised as I was.

497
00:27:44,12 --> 00:27:46,41


498
00:27:48,79 --> 00:27:49,95
What happened to you?

499
00:27:53,75 --> 00:27:55,62
I ran into a wall, like I do.

500
00:27:57,70 --> 00:27:59,12
You can't be here, Cass.

501
00:28:01,08 --> 00:28:02,58
Troopers won't catch me.

502
00:28:03,41 --> 00:28:04,45
Not here.

503
00:28:05,54 --> 00:28:06,62
They won't have to.

504
00:28:08,00 --> 00:28:09,04
You'll be turned in.

505
00:28:10,33 --> 00:28:12,08
-By who?
-By who?

506
00:28:12,16 --> 00:28:13,62
By anyone.

507
00:28:13,70 --> 00:28:15,58
People blame you for what happened.

508
00:28:17,33 --> 00:28:18,62
Blame me?

509
00:28:20,95 --> 00:28:23,95
You killed two Corpos
and came home to hide.

510
00:28:25,04 --> 00:28:26,29
Put the entire town at risk.

511
00:28:26,37 --> 00:28:29,62
-Now there's Imperials on the street.
-If Timm had kept his mouth shut.

512
00:28:29,70 --> 00:28:32,79
If this, if that. If you, if me, if Timm.

513
00:28:32,87 --> 00:28:34,16
We were doing a deal you...

514
00:28:34,25 --> 00:28:38,08
You scam, you borrow,
you lie, you disappear.

515
00:28:38,16 --> 00:28:41,50
Your crazy boyfriend tries
to get me killed, and I'm the villain?

516
00:28:41,58 --> 00:28:43,83
You need to get as far away
from here as you can.

517
00:28:43,91 --> 00:28:45,08


518
00:28:46,58 --> 00:28:48,33
 Wow.

519
00:28:50,83 --> 00:28:51,91
I will.

520
00:28:53,62 --> 00:28:54,62
I am.

521
00:28:55,91 --> 00:28:58,41
You won't have to worry about me anymore.

522
00:29:03,62 --> 00:29:05,37


523
00:29:05,45 --> 00:29:06,95
I need to know about the other guy.

524
00:29:07,04 --> 00:29:09,45
The buyer, who is he?

525
00:29:09,54 --> 00:29:11,54
-I don't know.
-You're lying.

526
00:29:12,37 --> 00:29:13,37
I'm not.

527
00:29:13,45 --> 00:29:15,87
Paak introduced us,
but swears he doesn't know either.

528
00:29:15,95 --> 00:29:17,62
I have a comm. I call. I wait.

529
00:29:17,70 --> 00:29:19,16
Sometimes they respond.

530
00:29:19,25 --> 00:29:21,12
He knew all about me. How?

531
00:29:21,20 --> 00:29:22,41
I... I don't know.

532
00:29:22,50 --> 00:29:23,79
And you're right, he did know.

533
00:29:23,87 --> 00:29:26,29
He knew that the Corpos were on you.
But not from me.

534
00:29:30,08 --> 00:29:35,66
 You ever talk to him again,
tell him I held up my end of the deal,

535
00:29:36,62 --> 00:29:38,50
and he needs to forget about me.

536
00:29:40,16 --> 00:29:41,75
And that goes for everybody. 

537
00:29:46,91 --> 00:29:48,29
I've done it before.

538
00:29:52,00 --> 00:29:53,25
12,000 credits.

539
00:29:54,70 --> 00:29:56,62
That's everything I owe. 

540
00:29:57,70 --> 00:30:01,12
Xan, Nurchi, Brasso, Deema.

541
00:30:01,20 --> 00:30:02,62
Twelve should cover it.

542
00:30:05,00 --> 00:30:06,16
Be careful, Cass.

543
00:30:06,25 --> 00:30:07,29
You too.

544
00:30:07,37 --> 00:30:08,62


545
00:30:24,25 --> 00:30:26,25


546
00:30:37,41 --> 00:30:39,87


547
00:30:43,87 --> 00:30:45,08


548
00:30:45,16 --> 00:30:48,83
-CLEM: This is not our fight, Cass.


549
00:30:48,91 --> 00:30:50,95
 Don't worry.
They won't be here long.

550
00:30:51,04 --> 00:30:53,87
They're just gonna raise
their silly flag and fly away.

551
00:30:53,95 --> 00:30:55,50
MAN: Long live the Republic!

552
00:30:55,58 --> 00:30:57,70
-MAN 2: Free Ferrix!


553
00:30:57,79 --> 00:30:59,54
Don't move. Stay here.

554
00:31:00,79 --> 00:31:02,33
Hey, guys! Calm down!

555
00:31:03,16 --> 00:31:05,12
-You're only making things worse!
-OFFICER: Halt!

556
00:31:05,95 --> 00:31:07,25


557
00:31:07,91 --> 00:31:08,91
OFFICER: Turn!

558
00:31:09,91 --> 00:31:12,91


559
00:31:13,00 --> 00:31:14,91
Ready arms!

560
00:31:20,25 --> 00:31:23,50


561
00:31:23,58 --> 00:31:24,58


562
00:31:26,83 --> 00:31:29,20


563
00:31:34,08 --> 00:31:36,04



564
00:31:36,12 --> 00:31:37,16
B2EMO: M-M-Maarva.

565
00:31:38,00 --> 00:31:39,08
He's b-b-back.

566
00:31:45,33 --> 00:31:47,45
I was coming to find you.

567
00:31:47,54 --> 00:31:48,54
CASSIAN: Here I am.

568
00:31:49,87 --> 00:31:51,87
You haven't done much packing.

569
00:31:51,95 --> 00:31:53,50
B2EMO: She says we can't go.

570
00:31:53,58 --> 00:31:55,33
MAARVA: Bee. Quiet.

571
00:31:59,37 --> 00:32:00,45
CASSIAN: What is this?

572
00:32:00,54 --> 00:32:01,66
I'm not going.

573
00:32:01,75 --> 00:32:03,95
What are you talking about?

574
00:32:04,04 --> 00:32:05,20
MAARVA: I'm staying.

575
00:32:05,29 --> 00:32:07,12
CASSIAN: But it's... it's not safe.

576
00:32:07,83 --> 00:32:09,08
I know all that.

577
00:32:09,16 --> 00:32:10,75
CASSIAN: I can't be here.

578
00:32:12,20 --> 00:32:15,37
You said it yourself,
"It's all come undone."

579
00:32:16,16 --> 00:32:18,45
There's an Imperial barracks on Rix Road.

580
00:32:18,54 --> 00:32:19,91
Good luck to them.

581
00:32:20,58 --> 00:32:23,29
-You wanna live under that?
-It's happening everywhere.

582
00:32:23,37 --> 00:32:26,00
 Well, we'll find a place
they haven't ruined yet.

583
00:32:26,08 --> 00:32:27,33
I'm already there.

584
00:32:28,37 --> 00:32:29,54
That place is in my head.

585
00:32:29,62 --> 00:32:32,75
They can build as many barracks
as they like, they'll never find me.

586
00:32:32,83 --> 00:32:34,29
 What's left to keep you here?

587
00:32:36,50 --> 00:32:37,83
The Rebellion. 

588
00:32:38,83 --> 00:32:39,83
What?

589
00:32:40,91 --> 00:32:44,12
Ferrix has been hiding long enough.

590
00:32:44,20 --> 00:32:46,37
So now you're taking on the Empire?

591
00:32:46,50 --> 00:32:49,16
 Laugh if you want to.

592
00:32:49,25 --> 00:32:51,25
Who's laughing? This is madness.

593
00:32:51,33 --> 00:32:52,33
No, it's not.

594
00:32:52,41 --> 00:32:57,25
It's overdue, and probably doomed,
and I'm too old, and I don't care anymore.

595
00:32:58,37 --> 00:33:01,16
For 13 years,
every time I walk down Rix Road,

596
00:33:01,25 --> 00:33:02,87
I turn off before I get to the square.

597
00:33:02,95 --> 00:33:04,04
I take the long way around

598
00:33:04,12 --> 00:33:06,25
so I don't have to think
about Clem hanging there.

599
00:33:06,33 --> 00:33:07,33


600
00:33:08,08 --> 00:33:09,45


601
00:33:09,54 --> 00:33:12,70



602
00:33:13,75 --> 00:33:16,45
Then yesterday,
I heard about this attack at Aldhani.

603
00:33:16,54 --> 00:33:18,04
Have you heard about this?

604
00:33:18,12 --> 00:33:19,16
What about it?

605
00:33:19,25 --> 00:33:20,66
Well, Bee played me the news.

606
00:33:20,75 --> 00:33:22,79
Do you know what I'm talking about?

607
00:33:22,87 --> 00:33:26,00
CASSIAN: Yeah, yeah,
the garrison at Aldhani.

608
00:33:26,62 --> 00:33:28,83
I heard that, I put on my best coat,

609
00:33:28,91 --> 00:33:30,37
and I walked across the square

610
00:33:30,45 --> 00:33:31,87
-with a smile on my face.


611
00:33:33,83 --> 00:33:39,08
If there are heroes brave enough
to take on a whole Imperial garrison,

612
00:33:39,16 --> 00:33:41,12
I'm brave enough to stick it out here.

613
00:33:41,25 --> 00:33:44,25


614
00:33:45,50 --> 00:33:47,91
I... I don't expect you to understand.

615
00:33:51,37 --> 00:33:53,66
Aldhani was just a robbery.

616
00:33:53,75 --> 00:33:56,12
People are standing up.

617
00:33:56,20 --> 00:33:58,08
Yeah, and getting killed for it.

618
00:33:59,00 --> 00:34:01,00
But there's work that will need doing.

619
00:34:01,08 --> 00:34:03,08
Yeah?  What is that?

620
00:34:03,16 --> 00:34:04,70
Whatever it takes.

621
00:34:04,79 --> 00:34:06,95
I've been lying around
waiting to die long enough.

622
00:34:07,08 --> 00:34:08,08


623
00:34:08,16 --> 00:34:09,95
You can't beat them, Maarva.

624
00:34:10,04 --> 00:34:12,70
Not if I run away.

625
00:34:12,83 --> 00:34:14,37


626
00:34:14,45 --> 00:34:18,25
You have a different path, Cass,
and I am not judging you.

627
00:34:19,70 --> 00:34:21,12
Everything you've been through,

628
00:34:21,20 --> 00:34:24,29
everything that was taken away from you
before you even started?

629
00:34:24,37 --> 00:34:25,37


630
00:34:25,45 --> 00:34:28,58
Take all the money you've found
and go and find some peace.

631
00:34:28,66 --> 00:34:30,25
I won't have peace.

632
00:34:32,08 --> 00:34:33,91
I'll be worried about you all the time.

633
00:34:35,50 --> 00:34:36,79
That's just love.

634
00:34:39,00 --> 00:34:40,87
Nothing you can do about that.

635
00:34:43,04 --> 00:34:45,25
I've never loved anything
the way I love you,

636
00:34:46,25 --> 00:34:50,16
and I've never fretted on anything more,
but this time...

637
00:34:50,25 --> 00:34:52,62


638
00:34:53,66 --> 00:34:56,91
you can't stay, and I can't go.

639
00:34:59,58 --> 00:35:00,79


640
00:35:03,25 --> 00:35:05,12
-B2EMO: C-C-Can I speak now?
-No!

641
00:35:05,66 --> 00:35:07,33


642
00:35:07,41 --> 00:35:09,70
Tell me you understand.

643
00:35:10,70 --> 00:35:11,79
I don't.

644
00:35:14,37 --> 00:35:16,08
You will.  You'll see.

645
00:35:22,29 --> 00:35:23,95


646
00:35:27,91 --> 00:35:32,25
And just one more thing... Just... 

647
00:35:33,33 --> 00:35:34,91
Stop searching for your sister.

648
00:35:35,00 --> 00:35:36,66
It's a fantasy.

649
00:35:39,37 --> 00:35:41,37
There were no survivors on Kenari.

650
00:35:46,54 --> 00:35:48,66
What happened there
was not your responsibility.

651
00:35:48,75 --> 00:35:50,00
You were a child.

652
00:35:54,33 --> 00:35:56,04
-Let it go.


653
00:35:58,87 --> 00:36:03,04
I'm coming back. 

654
00:36:03,12 --> 00:36:04,45
MAARVA: Of course you are.

655
00:36:05,00 --> 00:36:06,70


656
00:36:17,20 --> 00:36:20,62
JUNG: The alternative analysis is that
by comparing the detention numbers

657
00:36:20,70 --> 00:36:22,62
to the frequency of surprise inspections

658
00:36:22,70 --> 00:36:24,70
we're under-allocating
our harbor patrol units.

659
00:36:24,79 --> 00:36:28,16
So, three theories, Mr. Jung?

660
00:36:28,25 --> 00:36:29,25
Yes, sir.

661
00:36:29,33 --> 00:36:31,62
Three possible explanations

662
00:36:31,70 --> 00:36:35,45
for why you have failed to keep pace
with your neighboring sectors.

663
00:36:36,33 --> 00:36:38,08
-That's correct.
-I'm correct?

664
00:36:38,16 --> 00:36:40,08
Your approval is heartening.

665
00:36:40,16 --> 00:36:42,20
Your guidance would be welcome, sir.

666
00:36:42,29 --> 00:36:45,50
Very well, let's have a full audit
of all hyperspace lanes

667
00:36:45,58 --> 00:36:49,83
leading to Ord Mantell
on my desk by this time tomorrow.

668
00:36:49,91 --> 00:36:51,00
As you wish.

669
00:36:51,87 --> 00:36:54,33
-PARTAGAZ: Mr. Blevin.
-Sir.

670
00:36:55,33 --> 00:36:57,50
I sense something eager
in you this morning.

671
00:36:58,41 --> 00:36:59,41
Am I mistaken?

672
00:37:00,25 --> 00:37:02,79
 No, sir. And at risk
of repetition, you are correct.

673
00:37:03,62 --> 00:37:04,70
Good news, is it?

674
00:37:04,79 --> 00:37:05,79
I'm afraid not.

675
00:37:06,70 --> 00:37:09,08
I wish to lodge a charge
against a fellow supervisor.

676
00:37:09,95 --> 00:37:11,16
Proceed.

677
00:37:11,25 --> 00:37:13,20
I believe our Sector Protocols,

678
00:37:13,29 --> 00:37:15,33
as described in the ISB Code Of Conduct,

679
00:37:15,41 --> 00:37:18,95
are being violated by Supervisor Meero,
and that this overreach,

680
00:37:19,04 --> 00:37:23,29
for which she was previously reprimanded,
risks compromising Imperial safety

681
00:37:23,37 --> 00:37:25,91
to a degree that silence
is no longer possible.

682
00:37:26,00 --> 00:37:27,95
You think this forum appropriate?

683
00:37:28,04 --> 00:37:29,04
I do.

684
00:37:29,12 --> 00:37:30,62
It's a serious charge.

685
00:37:30,70 --> 00:37:33,29
BLEVIN: I believe
you'll share my sense of urgency.

686
00:37:34,37 --> 00:37:35,41
Supervisor Meero,

687
00:37:35,50 --> 00:37:38,37
do you mind having your integrity
ventilated in public?

688
00:37:38,45 --> 00:37:39,75
No, sir.

689
00:37:39,83 --> 00:37:43,20
Supervisor Blevin obviously finds
my conduct a more interesting subject

690
00:37:43,29 --> 00:37:45,87
than the advancement
of Integrated Imperial Security.

691
00:37:45,95 --> 00:37:49,37
He's put a lot into it,
I'm curious to hear his insights.

692
00:37:49,45 --> 00:37:51,70
PARTAGAZ: This is Ferrix, is it not?

693
00:37:51,79 --> 00:37:53,12
Yes, sir.

694
00:37:53,20 --> 00:37:54,20
Your sector.

695
00:37:54,29 --> 00:37:57,08
There was an unusual piece
of Naval equipment recovered.

696
00:37:57,16 --> 00:37:58,87
Meero wanted your crime reports.

697
00:37:58,95 --> 00:38:01,08
You determined her request
was out of order

698
00:38:01,16 --> 00:38:04,25
-and in violation of the chain of command.
-DEDRA: That's not accurate.

699
00:38:04,33 --> 00:38:07,12
You advised me
to reinforce my suspicions with data

700
00:38:07,20 --> 00:38:09,04
and to be careful
in my work going forward.

701
00:38:09,12 --> 00:38:10,12
Careful?

702
00:38:11,04 --> 00:38:13,12
Is that your defense?
You've been "careful"?

703
00:38:14,16 --> 00:38:16,41
I'd be curious
how many people at this table

704
00:38:16,50 --> 00:38:19,87
will think it "careful" that you've found
a way to access our sector data

705
00:38:19,95 --> 00:38:21,20
without ever filing a request.

706
00:38:21,29 --> 00:38:22,75
PARTAGAZ: Is that true, Dedra?

707
00:38:24,87 --> 00:38:27,12
 Yes.

708
00:38:27,20 --> 00:38:29,83
I used the Imperial Emergency Act
in the wake of Aldhani

709
00:38:29,91 --> 00:38:32,66
to gather data across multiple sectors
without official sanction.

710
00:38:32,75 --> 00:38:34,45
But that is the wrong question.

711
00:38:34,54 --> 00:38:37,95
I'd like to know if anyone here believes
the Rebellion plans its actions

712
00:38:38,04 --> 00:38:40,70
around the artificially constructed
boundaries of our sectors.

713
00:38:40,79 --> 00:38:43,12
Major Partagaz created those sectors.

714
00:38:43,20 --> 00:38:45,70
As organizing principles,
not personal playthings.

715
00:38:45,79 --> 00:38:48,58
Do you think the rebels care
about the lines we draw on maps?

716
00:38:48,66 --> 00:38:51,37
You think the relevance of my work
has been supplanted?

717
00:38:52,33 --> 00:38:54,37

Systems either change or die.

718
00:38:58,08 --> 00:38:59,20
Sir.

719
00:39:02,45 --> 00:39:03,95
Thesis, please.

720
00:39:04,04 --> 00:39:06,33
DEDRA: There is a focused,
organized rebel effort

721
00:39:06,41 --> 00:39:09,37
to acquire highly-restricted
Imperial military components.

722
00:39:09,45 --> 00:39:10,45
Your evidence?

723
00:39:10,54 --> 00:39:12,79
By accessing unfiltered
Sector Crime Reports

724
00:39:12,87 --> 00:39:15,75
I can now prove a link between the theft
of our most secret equipment

725
00:39:15,83 --> 00:39:18,75
and its distribution
to rebel groups across the galaxy.

726
00:39:18,83 --> 00:39:22,00
This is hard, verifiable data
you are prepared to present?

727
00:39:22,08 --> 00:39:23,58
Yes, sir.

728
00:39:24,25 --> 00:39:28,12
I believe Supervisor Blevin is aware
I have a documented file ready to go.

729
00:39:28,20 --> 00:39:30,04
I believe his accusations
here this morning

730
00:39:30,12 --> 00:39:33,08
have more to do with self-preservation
than any sense of urgency.

731
00:39:33,16 --> 00:39:36,70
What's more urgent
than a renegade intelligence officer?

732
00:39:38,12 --> 00:39:42,62
Imagine if everyone in this room played
as loose with the rules as you.

733
00:39:42,70 --> 00:39:44,75
Excellent suggestion, Blevin.

734
00:39:46,04 --> 00:39:48,58
I'm wondering where we'd be right now
if everyone here

735
00:39:48,66 --> 00:39:51,16
showed the same endeavor
as Supervisor Meero.

736
00:39:52,79 --> 00:39:54,25
I'll have to think about that.

737
00:39:55,20 --> 00:39:59,29
For the moment, I'm reassigning
the Morlana sector to Supervisor Meero.

738
00:39:59,37 --> 00:40:01,50
Ferrix is of great interest to her

739
00:40:01,58 --> 00:40:04,04
and has clearly
become a distraction for you.

740
00:40:04,12 --> 00:40:07,20
 I see no urgent problem,
but, as always,

741
00:40:07,29 --> 00:40:10,37
I salute the provocative
exchange of ideas.

742
00:40:10,45 --> 00:40:12,87
Supervisor Grandi,
you will accelerate your schedule.

743
00:40:13,66 --> 00:40:16,79
Jung, I will expect your report
on Ord Mantell tomorrow.

744
00:40:18,04 --> 00:40:20,08
Thank you all for the lively session.

745
00:40:20,16 --> 00:40:22,91
Dedra, if you'd walk with me a moment.

746
00:40:35,00 --> 00:40:36,16
PARTAGAZ: Well-played.

747
00:40:36,83 --> 00:40:37,83
Thank you, sir.

748
00:40:38,62 --> 00:40:39,70
Watch your back.

749
00:40:46,41 --> 00:40:48,66


750
00:41:05,00 --> 00:41:08,29



751
00:41:09,12 --> 00:41:10,54


752
00:41:13,25 --> 00:41:14,70


753
00:41:14,87 --> 00:41:16,04
Keef.

754
00:41:20,75 --> 00:41:21,75
Keef?

755
00:41:22,37 --> 00:41:23,45


756
00:41:24,62 --> 00:41:26,25
I'll be out in a minute.

757
00:41:26,33 --> 00:41:27,54
What're you doing?

758
00:41:29,25 --> 00:41:30,37
Washing up.

759
00:41:33,83 --> 00:41:35,12
I'm gonna take a walk.

760
00:41:35,20 --> 00:41:36,45
WINDI: Well, we need stuff.

761
00:41:38,75 --> 00:41:39,75
Arkie's up the beach.

762
00:41:39,83 --> 00:41:40,83
He'll be open.

763
00:41:41,95 --> 00:41:43,75
CASSIAN:
I was planning to go the other way.

764
00:41:43,83 --> 00:41:45,75
Mmm, Arkie has the new flavors.

765
00:41:47,83 --> 00:41:49,00
And we need Peezos.

766
00:41:50,00 --> 00:41:51,33
Don't forget the Peezos.

767
00:41:52,12 --> 00:41:53,12
We ran out of Peezos?

768
00:41:53,83 --> 00:41:54,83
Peezos and Revnog.

769
00:41:55,95 --> 00:41:58,33
-The greenie green ones.


770
00:41:58,41 --> 00:42:00,00
WINDI: The greenie Revnog.

771
00:42:00,08 --> 00:42:01,50
You liked it, too.

772
00:42:03,12 --> 00:42:04,91
Keef? Are you listening?

773
00:42:05,00 --> 00:42:08,29

-Ah. 

774
00:42:08,37 --> 00:42:09,91


775
00:42:11,41 --> 00:42:13,41
MAN: Go! Go! Run!

776
00:42:13,95 --> 00:42:15,37
Go, go, go, go!

777
00:42:15,66 --> 00:42:17,70


778
00:42:17,79 --> 00:42:19,95
-SHORETROOPER: Hey, you! Stop!


779
00:42:20,37 --> 00:42:21,37
SHORETROOPER: Hold it!

780
00:42:27,08 --> 00:42:28,08

781
00:42:38,45 --> 00:42:40,87


782
00:42:42,75 --> 00:42:45,66


783
00:42:48,25 --> 00:42:50,79


784
00:43:01,54 --> 00:43:02,87
SHORETROOPER: What are you doing?

785
00:43:03,41 --> 00:43:05,75
-Excuse me?
-SHORETROOPER: You keep looking around.

786
00:43:05,83 --> 00:43:07,91
Just trying to figure out what's going on.

787
00:43:08,00 --> 00:43:09,16
SHORETROOPER: You a part of it?

788
00:43:09,25 --> 00:43:10,50
Part of what?

789
00:43:10,58 --> 00:43:12,08
SHORETROOPER: Don't play dumb.

790
00:43:12,16 --> 00:43:13,50

791
00:43:13,58 --> 00:43:14,66
SHORETROOPER: Back up.

792
00:43:15,50 --> 00:43:16,66
Stand right there.

793
00:43:17,54 --> 00:43:19,00
You look like you're sweating.

794
00:43:19,08 --> 00:43:21,50
-Well, it's hot.
-SHORETROOPER: Or you've been running.

795
00:43:21,58 --> 00:43:22,95
Why would I be running?

796
00:43:23,04 --> 00:43:25,00
SHORETROOPER:
Because you're a part of it.

797
00:43:25,08 --> 00:43:26,08
Part of what?

798
00:43:26,16 --> 00:43:29,12
-SHORETROOPER: I'll ask the questions.
-MAN: Go! Run!

799
00:43:29,20 --> 00:43:31,66
Pier Nine, Pier Nine,

800
00:43:31,75 --> 00:43:33,54
MAN: Move it! Go!

801
00:43:34,45 --> 00:43:36,58
I can wait for you here, if you want.

802
00:43:36,66 --> 00:43:37,83
SHORETROOPER: Friends of yours?

803
00:43:37,91 --> 00:43:40,29
-What?
-SHORETROOPER: You heard me.

804
00:43:40,37 --> 00:43:41,70
CASSIAN: Wait, no... Uh...

805
00:43:41,79 --> 00:43:44,41
 I don't know anybody here.
I'm a tourist.

806
00:43:44,50 --> 00:43:46,41
SHORETROOPER: Tourists don't run.

807
00:43:46,50 --> 00:43:48,04
But I'm not running.

808
00:43:48,12 --> 00:43:51,00
SHORETROOPER: You got that right.
That window is shut.

809
00:43:51,08 --> 00:43:52,45



810
00:43:53,66 --> 00:43:55,04


811
00:43:55,12 --> 00:43:56,37
I'm just going to the store.

812
00:43:56,45 --> 00:43:57,58
It's right there.

813
00:43:57,66 --> 00:43:59,58
SHORETROOPER: You need to calm down, sir.

814
00:43:59,66 --> 00:44:01,16
Droid assistance, please.

815
00:44:02,33 --> 00:44:03,79


816
00:44:06,58 --> 00:44:09,75
Uh... What? Wait. What is he...
No, this is crazy. 

817
00:44:09,83 --> 00:44:12,50
SHORETROOPER: Hang onto this one for me.
I wanna check the shelter.

818

No, no, no. No.

No, you misunderstand.

822
00:44:19,83 --> 00:44:22,45
No, he... he meant watch.

823
00:44:22,54 --> 00:44:25,45

-No, no, he means watch. 

824
00:44:25,54 --> 00:44:27,66

00:44:34,45 --> 00:44:36,25

Tell him! 

828
00:44:38,54 --> 00:44:40,12
Tell him you mean watch!

829
00:44:45,41 --> 00:44:46,70
