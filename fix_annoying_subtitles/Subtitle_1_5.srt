1
00:00:02,00 --> 00:00:05,54
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?

2
00:00:06,29 --> 00:00:08,04
What would we be stealing?

3
00:00:08,12 --> 00:00:11,50
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

4
00:00:11,50 --> 00:00:13,62
Blevin, this incident on Ferrix.

5
00:00:13,62 --> 00:00:16,33
Corporate Security, sir.
They're still in charge out there.

6
00:00:16,33 --> 00:00:19,50
A stolen Imperial Starpath unit
was recovered at the scene.

7
00:00:19,50 --> 00:00:20,58
<i>Five months in?</i>

8
00:00:20,58 --> 00:00:23,12
Just plug in some new person?
It'll tear the team apart.

9
00:00:23,12 --> 00:00:24,87
I'm buying you critical redundancy.

10
00:00:24,87 --> 00:00:26,91
- What do you mean "buying"?
- I'm paying him.

11
00:00:27,00 --> 00:00:30,08
We've been eating roots
and sleeping on rocks for this rebellion

12
00:00:30,08 --> 00:00:32,04
and now you've got a mercenary on board?

13
00:00:32,12 --> 00:00:34,25
<i>Take him or call it off.</i>

14
00:00:34,25 --> 00:00:37,29
- You're taking on an Imperial armory?
- Are you not joining us?

15
00:00:37,37 --> 00:00:39,33
<i>Us? How many of us are there?</i>

16
00:00:39,33 --> 00:00:40,45
<i>Now we are seven.</i>

17
00:00:40,45 --> 00:00:41,95
That's Skeen.

18
00:00:41,95 --> 00:00:43,33
Taramyn.

19
00:00:43,33 --> 00:00:44,41
Nemik.

20
00:00:44,50 --> 00:00:46,50
- Cinta. And Lieutenant Gorn.
- Who is he?

21
00:00:46,50 --> 00:00:48,50
He's Clem.
He's here. That's all that matters.

22
00:00:48,50 --> 00:00:50,54
We're wasting daylight.
Let's get on with it.

23
00:00:50,62 --> 00:00:56,54
As of this morning, the Morlana system
is under permanent Imperial authority.

24
00:00:56,62 --> 00:00:58,04
<i>Congratulations on that.</i>

25
00:00:58,62 --> 00:00:59,83
Mother.

26
00:01:00,70 --> 00:01:01,91
Senator.

27
00:01:02,00 --> 00:01:04,79
- If you can't deliver, I need to know.
- The money's there.

28
00:01:04,87 --> 00:01:07,08
It's just getting very dangerous
to move it around.

29
00:01:07,08 --> 00:01:09,00
You think I haven't thought this through?

30
00:01:09,00 --> 00:01:10,87
I'd be the first one to fall.

31
00:01:10,87 --> 00:01:12,08
That's a vault.

32
00:01:12,66 --> 00:01:14,91
We're taking crates of payroll
from that room,

33
00:01:15,00 --> 00:01:17,87
loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.

34
00:01:17,87 --> 00:01:21,41
What we need to know is,
are you in all the way?

35
00:01:22,58 --> 00:01:23,95
Let's get to it.

36
00:02:49,37 --> 00:02:50,37
Syril.

37
00:02:51,33 --> 00:02:52,79
You're slouching.

38
00:02:59,75 --> 00:03:02,41
Is that how you've been
presenting yourself to the world?

39
00:03:03,58 --> 00:03:05,16
It would explain a great deal.

40
00:03:08,79 --> 00:03:13,54
Being a leader
isn't something one just turns on and off.

41
00:03:15,95 --> 00:03:19,41
By the time you've remembered
to sit up straight, it's too late.

42
00:03:21,08 --> 00:03:26,04
You might as well wear a sign that says,
"I promise to disappoint you."

43
00:03:27,87 --> 00:03:31,20
Shame we couldn't have seen more
of each other when you were flourishing.

44
00:03:31,20 --> 00:03:33,16
I'd have the memory to sustain me.

45
00:03:34,00 --> 00:03:36,41
Well, you could've come
any time you wanted.

46
00:03:36,50 --> 00:03:41,37
Any civilized being knows an open
invitation is no invitation at all.

47
00:03:41,37 --> 00:03:45,45
My assumption is,
you have no prospect for the future.

48
00:03:45,45 --> 00:03:46,62
I had a spare room.

49
00:03:48,25 --> 00:03:49,95
Could've visited any time you wanted.

50
00:03:49,95 --> 00:03:52,08
- You know that.
- I know what you tell me.

51
00:03:52,08 --> 00:03:53,37
I intuit the rest.

52
00:03:53,37 --> 00:03:57,20
I intuit you have no future prospects.

53
00:03:57,83 --> 00:04:00,25
I'd forgotten the precision
of your predictive powers.

54
00:04:01,20 --> 00:04:04,54
- Ah, you've remembered how to mock me.
- Forgotten how sensitive you can be.

55
00:04:04,62 --> 00:04:06,20
Perhaps you've forgotten my question.

56
00:04:06,20 --> 00:04:09,79
Do you have even
a single prospect before you?

57
00:04:11,54 --> 00:04:12,62
I'll find a way.

58
00:04:15,20 --> 00:04:16,54
I'm calling Uncle Harlo.

59
00:04:16,66 --> 00:04:18,87
I'm calling in the family favor.

60
00:04:18,87 --> 00:04:20,45
Haven't heard that in a while.

61
00:04:20,45 --> 00:04:21,79
These are desperate times.

62
00:04:21,87 --> 00:04:24,54
- You're assuming he'll remember you.
- That's amusing.

63
00:04:24,62 --> 00:04:26,25
And you think he'll talk to you?

64
00:04:26,25 --> 00:04:27,37
I know he will.

65
00:04:27,37 --> 00:04:29,12
And he'll know why I called.

66
00:04:29,12 --> 00:04:31,91
And he'll respect me
for having waited so long in asking

67
00:04:32,00 --> 00:04:34,29
and being so prudent about my request.

68
00:04:34,37 --> 00:04:36,95
What is it you'll be asking for?

69
00:04:37,95 --> 00:04:40,62
Someone who will take you on, Syril.

70
00:04:40,62 --> 00:04:42,37
Setting the bar high, are we?

71
00:04:43,00 --> 00:04:45,33
Uncle Harlo will know what's best.

72
00:05:31,50 --> 00:05:32,62
It's all there.

73
00:05:33,70 --> 00:05:35,25
Vel asked me to have a look.

74
00:05:36,58 --> 00:05:39,50
I think
she's having second thoughts.

75
00:05:41,62 --> 00:05:43,08
Go talk to her if you want.

76
00:05:43,08 --> 00:05:44,20
She'll be up soon.

77
00:05:47,83 --> 00:05:49,16
You didn't come with much.

78
00:05:50,45 --> 00:05:51,70
That plus the bad arm?

79
00:05:51,70 --> 00:05:54,25
It's pretty clear
you left wherever you were in a hurry.

80
00:05:57,00 --> 00:05:59,45
Corporate issue. Interesting.

81
00:06:01,25 --> 00:06:03,20
There's no sense bein' upset.

82
00:06:04,45 --> 00:06:06,20
You're lucky to be alive right now.

83
00:06:07,54 --> 00:06:10,29
We've been down here for months,
and the stakes are high.

84
00:06:11,50 --> 00:06:13,37
- How's your arm?
- I'll be fine.

85
00:06:13,37 --> 00:06:14,50
Uh-huh.

86
00:06:15,37 --> 00:06:17,70
And, uh, who... whose is this?

87
00:06:19,16 --> 00:06:20,20
Didn't get a name.

88
00:06:27,79 --> 00:06:28,79
Oh.

89
00:06:29,83 --> 00:06:31,66
You know what this means, don't you?

90
00:06:33,16 --> 00:06:35,08
Yeah, I saw your eyes go right to it.

91
00:06:36,08 --> 00:06:37,12
Krayt Head.

92
00:06:38,37 --> 00:06:39,70
See, they don't know.

93
00:06:41,41 --> 00:06:42,54
They got no idea.

94
00:06:44,75 --> 00:06:45,87
What about this?

95
00:06:47,50 --> 00:06:49,04
"By The Hand."

96
00:06:50,58 --> 00:06:51,66
So, where were you?

97
00:06:53,12 --> 00:06:54,37
Sipo.

98
00:06:54,37 --> 00:06:55,54
Youth center.

99
00:06:56,70 --> 00:06:58,83
Three years. I was 13 when I went in.

100
00:07:00,62 --> 00:07:01,75
I never heard of it.

101
00:07:03,08 --> 00:07:05,54
- Well, you didn't miss anything.
- Yeah.

102
00:07:06,62 --> 00:07:08,50
They've built a lot of cages, huh?

103
00:07:09,16 --> 00:07:11,41
"The axe forgets, but the tree remembers."

104
00:07:13,66 --> 00:07:15,50
Now it's our turn to do the chopping.

105
00:07:17,54 --> 00:07:18,62
So, that's it?

106
00:07:18,62 --> 00:07:20,04
That's why you're here?

107
00:07:20,12 --> 00:07:21,12
Revenge?

108
00:07:22,29 --> 00:07:23,83
Yeah, that's good enough for now.

109
00:07:25,41 --> 00:07:26,41
You?

110
00:07:29,66 --> 00:07:31,54
I was told I could help.

111
00:07:32,20 --> 00:07:34,08
Yeah, but you won't say by who.

112
00:07:35,00 --> 00:07:37,08
Working with other people is never easy.

113
00:07:37,91 --> 00:07:38,91
Yeah.

114
00:07:39,70 --> 00:07:41,95
I didn't mark you for a team player.

115
00:07:43,50 --> 00:07:45,50
It always breaks at the weakest point.

116
00:07:45,50 --> 00:07:47,08
Oh, you're worried about the kids.

117
00:07:48,66 --> 00:07:50,33
Nemik's a surprise.

118
00:07:50,33 --> 00:07:51,75
He's green, but he's all in.

119
00:07:51,75 --> 00:07:53,12
He's a true believer.

120
00:07:53,12 --> 00:07:54,58
Nothing but the cause for him.

121
00:07:56,50 --> 00:07:57,50
Then there's Cinta.

122
00:07:57,50 --> 00:07:59,00
Cinta Kaz.

123
00:07:59,70 --> 00:08:01,75
She's stone cold and fearless.

124
00:08:02,41 --> 00:08:04,08
Probably the toughest one here.

125
00:08:05,66 --> 00:08:08,87
She's already sharin' a blanket,
if that's what you're wonderin'.

126
00:08:11,12 --> 00:08:12,20
And the Lieutenant?

127
00:08:13,58 --> 00:08:15,16
Without him, there's no plan.

128
00:08:15,25 --> 00:08:17,58
He could be walking us right into a trap.

129
00:08:17,58 --> 00:08:19,75
They would've taken us down by now.

130
00:08:21,75 --> 00:08:23,50
Or maybe that's what you're here for.

131
00:08:27,25 --> 00:08:29,41
I'm here to win and walk away.

132
00:08:31,33 --> 00:08:32,66
Wouldn't that be lovely?

133
00:08:46,25 --> 00:08:47,50
The driver's here.

134
00:08:48,25 --> 00:08:49,50
Kloris.

135
00:08:49,50 --> 00:08:50,58
Yes.

136
00:08:52,45 --> 00:08:53,62
You know his name.

137
00:08:54,62 --> 00:08:55,62
Is Leida ready?

138
00:08:57,16 --> 00:08:58,16
I'm not sure.

139
00:08:58,79 --> 00:09:00,70
Where is she? Leida?

140
00:09:04,70 --> 00:09:06,33
Hmm. Did you eat?

141
00:09:06,33 --> 00:09:07,75
When would that have happened?

142
00:09:07,75 --> 00:09:08,87
I just came down.

143
00:09:08,87 --> 00:09:10,25
Take something for the ride.

144
00:09:10,25 --> 00:09:11,95
- What?
- We need to be going.

145
00:09:12,50 --> 00:09:13,91
Oh. Change in plan.

146
00:09:14,00 --> 00:09:15,00
Dad's taking me.

147
00:09:15,45 --> 00:09:16,75
You're taking me, right?

148
00:09:17,50 --> 00:09:19,08
Got to clear it with her.

149
00:09:21,41 --> 00:09:23,08
I don't have early class today.

150
00:09:24,04 --> 00:09:26,12
- We planned this.
- You did.

151
00:09:26,83 --> 00:09:29,00
Get your coat. It's not up for discussion.

152
00:09:29,00 --> 00:09:30,58
Are you serious?

153
00:09:30,58 --> 00:09:32,08
Am I serious?

154
00:09:32,08 --> 00:09:34,33
Just go. You're off the hook.

155
00:09:35,62 --> 00:09:36,95
Enjoying this?

156
00:09:38,08 --> 00:09:39,20
Get your coat.

157
00:09:39,79 --> 00:09:42,00
It's out of your way anyway,
so what's the point?

158
00:09:42,00 --> 00:09:44,50
The point is, we have a schedule,
the driver's waiting,

159
00:09:44,50 --> 00:09:48,00
- I've planned on this, and we're going.
- You're only doing it to show off.

160
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:49,50
- What?
- Just go.

161
00:09:50,62 --> 00:09:52,25
What would I be showing off?

162
00:09:52,25 --> 00:09:54,16
That you're involved somehow.

163
00:09:56,45 --> 00:09:57,91
What? That's just...

164
00:09:58,00 --> 00:10:00,00
Nobody cares. You can relax.

165
00:10:01,45 --> 00:10:03,54
That's just so hurtful.

166
00:10:04,37 --> 00:10:06,54
- See? There you go.
- Go where?

167
00:10:06,62 --> 00:10:07,79
That's my point.

168
00:10:08,66 --> 00:10:10,29
It's all about you, isn't it?

169
00:10:10,37 --> 00:10:11,45
It's always all about you.

170
00:10:11,45 --> 00:10:13,50
Is this really
how you'd like to start the day?

171
00:10:13,50 --> 00:10:15,12
I didn't choose this conversation.

172
00:10:21,95 --> 00:10:23,62
I so appreciate the support.

173
00:10:44,70 --> 00:10:45,70
Dray milk.

174
00:10:48,54 --> 00:10:49,70
You can live on it.

175
00:10:49,70 --> 00:10:52,70
You may question your existence
after a few days, but...

176
00:10:55,95 --> 00:10:57,37
Memorable, isn't it?

177
00:11:04,12 --> 00:11:05,41
That's an old one.

178
00:11:05,50 --> 00:11:06,95
Old and true.

179
00:11:06,95 --> 00:11:08,04
And sturdy.

180
00:11:08,12 --> 00:11:10,45
One of the best
navigational tools ever built.

181
00:11:10,95 --> 00:11:12,33
Can't be jammed or intercepted.

182
00:11:12,33 --> 00:11:14,50
Something breaks, you can fix it yourself.

183
00:11:15,33 --> 00:11:16,66
Hard to learn.

184
00:11:16,75 --> 00:11:20,12
Yes, but once you've mastered it,
you're free.

185
00:11:20,83 --> 00:11:24,00
We've grown reliant on Imperial tech,
and we've made ourselves vulnerable.

186
00:11:24,00 --> 00:11:26,16
There's a growing list
of things we've known and forgotten,

187
00:11:26,25 --> 00:11:27,58
things they've pushed us to forget.

188
00:11:27,58 --> 00:11:29,37
Things like freedom.

189
00:11:30,54 --> 00:11:32,33
Nemik sees oppression everywhere.

190
00:11:32,95 --> 00:11:36,25
Skeen pretends not to listen,
but I know the message is sinking in.

191
00:11:37,50 --> 00:11:39,45
He's writin' a manifesto.

192
00:11:39,45 --> 00:11:40,54
Did he tell you?

193
00:11:41,16 --> 00:11:44,37
Apparently, the only thing keepin' us
from liberty is a few more ideas.

194
00:11:44,37 --> 00:11:45,54
Few more ideas.

195
00:11:45,62 --> 00:11:46,95
It's so confusing, isn't it?

196
00:11:46,95 --> 00:11:50,37
So much going wrong, so much to say,
and all of it happening so quickly.

197
00:11:50,37 --> 00:11:53,20
The pace of repression
outstrips our ability to understand it.

198
00:11:53,20 --> 00:11:55,45
And that is the real trick
of the Imperial thought machine.

199
00:11:55,45 --> 00:11:58,91
It's easier to hide behind
40 atrocities than a single incident.

200
00:11:59,00 --> 00:12:01,12
But they have a fight on their hands,
don't they?

201
00:12:01,12 --> 00:12:03,79
Our elemental rights
are such a simple thing to hold,

202
00:12:03,87 --> 00:12:06,45
they will have to shake the galaxy hard
to loosen our grip.

203
00:12:06,45 --> 00:12:08,20
I'd like to hear what Clem believes.

204
00:12:11,29 --> 00:12:12,66
I know what I'm against.

205
00:12:13,79 --> 00:12:15,45
Everything else will have to wait.

206
00:12:15,45 --> 00:12:17,37
You're my ideal reader.

207
00:12:17,37 --> 00:12:20,37
- Now you've done it.
- Haven't titled it yet. I've been waiting.

208
00:12:20,37 --> 00:12:23,37
It's a work in progress, and I know
that there's a great deal left to say.

209
00:12:23,37 --> 00:12:24,75
I mean, look.

210
00:12:24,75 --> 00:12:25,83
Right here.

211
00:12:26,37 --> 00:12:27,37
Fresh inspiration.

212
00:12:27,37 --> 00:12:30,04
Two seemingly random objects,
and yet this charts an astral path,

213
00:12:30,12 --> 00:12:32,25
this maps the trail
of political consciousness.

214
00:12:32,25 --> 00:12:33,37
Both systems based on truth,

215
00:12:33,37 --> 00:12:35,58
both navigating toward clear
and achievable outcomes.

216
00:12:35,58 --> 00:12:37,16
- Basic facts expanded to...
- Clem.

217
00:12:39,50 --> 00:12:40,50
To be continued.

218
00:12:42,70 --> 00:12:44,62
Busy day, Clem. Finish your milk.

219
00:12:58,50 --> 00:13:00,12
You don't trust him?

220
00:13:00,41 --> 00:13:01,58
- I barely trust you.
- Hmm.

221
00:13:02,16 --> 00:13:04,29
Obviously, it's a track launch,

222
00:13:04,37 --> 00:13:07,20
so there's an adjusted thrust ratio
to make it up the ramp.

223
00:13:07,20 --> 00:13:09,25
- Okay.
- It's on an overhead rail.

224
00:13:10,83 --> 00:13:13,16
- Has to be, yeah.
- So calibrating the weight...

225
00:13:15,62 --> 00:13:17,58
- What about it?
- How would you do it?

226
00:13:17,58 --> 00:13:19,29
How would I know the weight?

227
00:13:20,58 --> 00:13:21,83
Is this a test?

228
00:13:22,70 --> 00:13:23,79
It's a simple question.

229
00:13:26,20 --> 00:13:28,58
You don't know
how to get it off the runway, do you?

230
00:13:28,58 --> 00:13:29,87
We know how to fly it.

231
00:13:29,87 --> 00:13:31,91
Yeah, but you've
got to get it up there first.

232
00:13:32,00 --> 00:13:33,45
Answer the question.

233
00:13:33,87 --> 00:13:35,33
You really don't.

234
00:13:36,29 --> 00:13:37,33
Do you?

235
00:13:37,75 --> 00:13:39,50
You don't know how to get it out of there.

236
00:13:39,50 --> 00:13:41,45
How do you input the weight?

237
00:13:42,70 --> 00:13:44,91
- You sure it's on the rail?
- Yes.

238
00:13:45,00 --> 00:13:46,62
It's mounted?

239
00:13:46,62 --> 00:13:47,95
It's ready to go?

240
00:13:47,95 --> 00:13:49,70
That's how they keep it,
you're sure of that?

241
00:13:49,70 --> 00:13:51,00
Yes, we're sure.

242
00:13:51,58 --> 00:13:54,66
Lieutenant Gorn is in there every day.

243
00:13:55,33 --> 00:13:56,33
Okay.

244
00:13:56,33 --> 00:13:57,95
There's a load clutch.

245
00:13:57,95 --> 00:14:01,91
It... It's a big ugly handle
just right next to the booster throttle.

246
00:14:02,62 --> 00:14:06,87
There's a gauge just below
to read out the weight.

247
00:14:06,87 --> 00:14:08,62
Why isn't this in the manual?

248
00:14:08,62 --> 00:14:10,79
Because it's a custom job.

249
00:14:10,87 --> 00:14:12,45
It's an add-on.

250
00:14:12,58 --> 00:14:15,45
What were you gonna do
if I wasn't here?

251
00:14:15,58 --> 00:14:18,33
Might have been ugly
but we'd have figured it out.

252
00:14:18,33 --> 00:14:20,08
We wanted to be sure.

253
00:14:20,25 --> 00:14:23,58
- Oh. Okay. I'll pilot.
- No, you'll do as you're told.

254
00:14:23,58 --> 00:14:24,75
Ah, I'm flying it.

255
00:14:24,75 --> 00:14:26,58
We can say it's your idea. I don't care.

256
00:14:26,58 --> 00:14:30,12
But if it's my ass on the line,
I'm pulling this thing out of there.

257
00:14:34,16 --> 00:14:35,75
- Okay.
- Okay.

258
00:14:52,83 --> 00:14:54,04
Clem.

259
00:14:59,25 --> 00:15:00,25
The tower yard.

260
00:15:01,41 --> 00:15:02,41
The dam.

261
00:15:03,00 --> 00:15:05,95
The garrison HQ
and the barracks up top by the east end.

262
00:15:07,04 --> 00:15:08,12
The Rono tunnel.

263
00:15:09,25 --> 00:15:10,70
The flight control tower.

264
00:15:11,45 --> 00:15:15,20
And objective number one,
the door at the base of the tower.

265
00:15:18,00 --> 00:15:19,12
The Temple Path.

266
00:15:20,16 --> 00:15:24,33
Now, the real thing has a downhill pitch,
but the distance is right.

267
00:15:25,50 --> 00:15:28,00
And down there,
where we'll be coming from,

268
00:15:29,04 --> 00:15:30,04
The Old Temple.

269
00:15:33,20 --> 00:15:34,20
Got it.

270
00:15:41,45 --> 00:15:42,54
What's this?

271
00:15:46,33 --> 00:15:47,33
Target practice?

272
00:15:50,25 --> 00:15:51,33
Where are they?

273
00:15:54,37 --> 00:15:55,91
This was to be cleaned up yesterday.

274
00:15:56,00 --> 00:15:58,04
- Where are they?
- They should be back soon, sir.

275
00:15:58,12 --> 00:15:59,41
Back from where?

276
00:15:59,50 --> 00:16:01,33
I believe they're in the tower, sir.

277
00:16:01,33 --> 00:16:04,41
The Commandant's wife needed help
moving furniture for the dinner.

278
00:16:08,33 --> 00:16:09,54
I'll be back in an hour.

279
00:16:09,62 --> 00:16:12,91
This had better be well on its way,
or I promise you,

280
00:16:13,00 --> 00:16:15,87
I'll be revisiting
the schedule for winter furloughs.

281
00:16:22,95 --> 00:16:25,45
You are Imperial Private Clem.

282
00:16:26,04 --> 00:16:30,54
You're a sentry from the Alkenzi Airbase
transferred for special duty.

283
00:16:31,83 --> 00:16:32,83
Shoulders back.

284
00:16:34,50 --> 00:16:35,75
- More.
- Don't touch me.

285
00:16:38,83 --> 00:16:40,50
You want something, you tell me.

286
00:16:43,50 --> 00:16:44,83
Can you walk like a soldier?

287
00:16:46,75 --> 00:16:48,00
I've seen it done.

288
00:16:49,25 --> 00:16:51,20
Let's find out
if you've been payin' attention.

289
00:16:51,20 --> 00:16:52,29
Form up.

290
00:17:07,70 --> 00:17:10,12
I don't care where it goes.
Just get it out of here.

291
00:17:10,12 --> 00:17:11,62
Yes, sir. Right away, sir.

292
00:17:12,37 --> 00:17:13,66
Captain Tigo!

293
00:17:16,70 --> 00:17:17,91
There you are.

294
00:17:18,00 --> 00:17:19,66
They're still clearing out some guests.

295
00:17:22,41 --> 00:17:23,70
What do you think?

296
00:17:23,70 --> 00:17:24,79
As a hotel?

297
00:17:26,25 --> 00:17:27,70
Do you want it or not?

298
00:17:28,25 --> 00:17:29,58
The assignment?

299
00:17:29,58 --> 00:17:31,45
No, you're taking the assignment.

300
00:17:31,45 --> 00:17:33,87
I was asking if this would do
as your headquarters.

301
00:17:35,79 --> 00:17:37,12
Could I be made Prefect?

302
00:17:37,95 --> 00:17:40,41
The title.
I know it doesn't come with extra pay.

303
00:17:40,50 --> 00:17:43,00
You can wear a ball gown if you'd like.

304
00:17:43,70 --> 00:17:46,50
Just get this up and running
before my next staff meeting.

305
00:17:54,62 --> 00:17:56,16
It's about confidence.

306
00:17:56,25 --> 00:17:57,70
We belong here.

307
00:17:57,70 --> 00:17:59,00
We're followin' orders.

308
00:17:59,95 --> 00:18:01,87
The door's bein' opened as we approach.

309
00:18:01,87 --> 00:18:04,75
Lieutenant Gorn will be out front.
He's the leader.

310
00:18:04,75 --> 00:18:06,04
He's the gatekeeper.

311
00:18:06,12 --> 00:18:08,54
So eyes on him at all times.

312
00:18:08,62 --> 00:18:10,54
We're locked in. We're listenin'.

313
00:18:11,00 --> 00:18:12,12
We're ready to adapt.

314
00:18:12,12 --> 00:18:15,37
And last man in bolts the door behind him.

315
00:18:16,50 --> 00:18:18,25
Squad, halt.

316
00:18:21,58 --> 00:18:22,58
Questions?

317
00:18:23,29 --> 00:18:24,66
What are they doing?

318
00:18:25,75 --> 00:18:26,87
Never mind about them.

319
00:18:26,87 --> 00:18:29,04
You got enough to worry about.

320
00:18:29,70 --> 00:18:31,08
Let's walk it again at speed.

321
00:18:32,20 --> 00:18:33,37
You should switch.

322
00:18:34,54 --> 00:18:35,54
What?

323
00:18:36,33 --> 00:18:37,62
He's left-handed.

324
00:18:38,25 --> 00:18:39,58
Should swap sides.

325
00:18:41,00 --> 00:18:43,33
Why don't you get a handle
on what we're doing here

326
00:18:43,33 --> 00:18:45,29
before you start making suggestions.

327
00:18:46,91 --> 00:18:48,20
Why?

328
00:18:49,54 --> 00:18:50,58
Why switch sides?

329
00:18:52,12 --> 00:18:53,37
Skeen is left-handed.

330
00:18:54,58 --> 00:18:56,16
You want your weapon on the outside.

331
00:18:59,12 --> 00:19:01,08
- What am I?
- Right-handed.

332
00:19:01,75 --> 00:19:02,75
Taramyn?

333
00:19:03,33 --> 00:19:04,70
- Right.
- Cinta?

334
00:19:04,70 --> 00:19:05,79
Right.

335
00:19:05,87 --> 00:19:07,04
Nemik?

336
00:19:07,12 --> 00:19:09,83
Favors right, but shoots left.

337
00:19:13,50 --> 00:19:14,50
Fine.

338
00:19:15,79 --> 00:19:16,79
Let's switch.

339
00:19:19,62 --> 00:19:21,29
Any other suggestions?

340
00:19:23,25 --> 00:19:24,33
Wait!

341
00:19:28,66 --> 00:19:29,75
Cover the guns.

342
00:19:31,08 --> 00:19:32,33
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

343
00:19:39,91 --> 00:19:42,08
- He's gone.
- I don't think so.

344
00:20:07,87 --> 00:20:08,87
They'll soon see.

345
00:20:09,87 --> 00:20:12,50
Surprise from above
is never as shocking as one from below.

346
00:20:26,45 --> 00:20:27,79
Corporal Kimzi.

347
00:20:27,87 --> 00:20:28,87
Sir.

348
00:20:29,58 --> 00:20:30,58
Enjoying the view?

349
00:20:30,58 --> 00:20:31,66
Yes, sir.

350
00:20:32,70 --> 00:20:34,75
Gets a bit stale in there sometimes.

351
00:20:38,04 --> 00:20:40,16
It's always inspiring, isn't it?

352
00:20:41,66 --> 00:20:42,75
I suppose.

353
00:20:45,12 --> 00:20:47,54
Is it true they're tearing this all down?

354
00:20:48,12 --> 00:20:49,20
It's been discussed.

355
00:20:49,95 --> 00:20:51,20
Move the airbase here?

356
00:20:52,62 --> 00:20:53,66
That makes sense.

357
00:20:53,75 --> 00:20:55,20
It's a big project.

358
00:20:55,20 --> 00:20:57,95
Not too many Dhanis
to worry about anymore though, eh?

359
00:20:59,04 --> 00:21:00,87
How many do you think we'll have tomorrow?

360
00:21:01,75 --> 00:21:02,75
I don't know.

361
00:21:03,95 --> 00:21:05,58
It was less than a hundred last time.

362
00:21:06,41 --> 00:21:08,25
Still enough to smell 'em, right?

363
00:21:10,33 --> 00:21:13,08
Can you imagine this place
with a couple of thousand of them?

364
00:21:15,79 --> 00:21:16,83
Yes.

365
00:21:18,50 --> 00:21:19,54
I can.

366
00:21:20,08 --> 00:21:21,54
Get about your business, Corporal.

367
00:21:21,62 --> 00:21:24,33
I'll be making rounds tomorrow night,
and I expect you at your station.

368
00:21:24,33 --> 00:21:25,50
Sir. Yes, sir.

369
00:21:46,83 --> 00:21:48,83
- "Hello."
- <i>Nahrvai.</i>

370
00:21:48,83 --> 00:21:49,95
Again.

371
00:21:49,95 --> 00:21:51,08
<i>Nahrvai.</i>

372
00:21:52,70 --> 00:21:53,75
"Stop."

373
00:21:53,75 --> 00:21:54,87
<i>Naishe.</i>

374
00:21:55,75 --> 00:21:56,79
<i>Naych.</i>

375
00:21:56,87 --> 00:21:57,87
It's hard.

376
00:21:58,33 --> 00:21:59,58
<i>Naych.</i>

377
00:21:59,70 --> 00:22:00,70
How's your arm?

378
00:22:00,70 --> 00:22:02,62
It's good. You're a healer.

379
00:22:04,00 --> 00:22:05,37
Hey! What are you doing?

380
00:22:05,37 --> 00:22:07,16
I'm just moving your stuff.

381
00:22:07,25 --> 00:22:09,08
- Don't.
- It was in the way.

382
00:22:09,08 --> 00:22:10,16
Don't ever.

383
00:22:10,25 --> 00:22:11,83
I thought you were checking the comms.

384
00:22:18,95 --> 00:22:20,37
Hey.

385
00:22:20,37 --> 00:22:21,83
And you can dress yourself.

386
00:22:22,45 --> 00:22:23,70
Who packed these charges?

387
00:22:23,70 --> 00:22:24,87
That would be me.

388
00:22:35,62 --> 00:22:36,87
I can fit three more in here.

389
00:22:44,16 --> 00:22:45,50
Let's have a look at you.

390
00:22:51,50 --> 00:22:52,83
Make a soldier of you yet.

391
00:22:56,29 --> 00:22:58,45
So, I'll want weekly reports from Ferrix.

392
00:22:58,45 --> 00:23:01,08
And I want to keep
a tight hand on the budget.

393
00:23:01,08 --> 00:23:03,50
Now, what did I miss while I was gone?

394
00:23:03,50 --> 00:23:04,83
The Finkly Conference.

395
00:23:04,83 --> 00:23:07,08
They have agreed to move up your speech...

396
00:23:11,08 --> 00:23:12,20
<i>Hosnian Prime?</i>

397
00:23:12,20 --> 00:23:13,33
<i>It's useless.</i>

398
00:23:13,33 --> 00:23:15,45
They haven't broken,
misplaced, or mislabeled

399
00:23:15,45 --> 00:23:17,83
a single military component
in the past 12 quarters.

400
00:23:17,83 --> 00:23:20,95
Well, maybe there's, uh,
an unofficial ledger.

401
00:23:20,95 --> 00:23:23,45
I... I wouldn't trust
anything coming out of there.

402
00:23:23,45 --> 00:23:26,04
Imperial Navy is the only account
they have left at this point,

403
00:23:26,12 --> 00:23:27,95
and they'd never admit anything's wrong.

404
00:23:27,95 --> 00:23:29,08
You should go.

405
00:23:29,08 --> 00:23:30,66
I didn't realize how late it was.

406
00:23:31,91 --> 00:23:33,33
I'm staying if you are.

407
00:23:33,33 --> 00:23:35,75
I don't know what I'm doing.

408
00:23:36,58 --> 00:23:37,75
About any of it.

409
00:23:37,75 --> 00:23:39,12
Yes, you do.

410
00:23:39,12 --> 00:23:40,54
You're onto something.

411
00:23:41,41 --> 00:23:44,95
Kessel, Fondor,
targeting consoles from Jakku,

412
00:23:44,95 --> 00:23:48,33
proton warheads from Base Cay,
the Steergard Starpath.

413
00:23:48,33 --> 00:23:49,62
He's right though.

414
00:23:50,66 --> 00:23:52,37
It's too spread out to be organized.

415
00:23:52,37 --> 00:23:53,79
But you don't believe that.

416
00:23:56,54 --> 00:23:58,12
I know this.

417
00:23:58,12 --> 00:24:01,62
If I was them, this is how I'd do it.

418
00:24:02,50 --> 00:24:03,75
I'd spread it out.

419
00:24:04,87 --> 00:24:07,16
Never climb the same fence twice.

420
00:24:07,83 --> 00:24:10,41
It's too random to be random.

421
00:24:14,25 --> 00:24:15,33
Two more files each?

422
00:25:11,00 --> 00:25:12,08
Stay focused, Clem.

423
00:25:15,50 --> 00:25:16,50
To the Rebellion.

424
00:25:17,75 --> 00:25:18,95
To the Rebellion.

425
00:25:51,12 --> 00:25:55,04
I needn't tell you how wrong
you were about Uncle Harlo.

426
00:25:55,12 --> 00:25:56,29
But you will.

427
00:25:56,37 --> 00:26:01,29
He said he never felt police work
was your chosen path.

428
00:26:01,37 --> 00:26:02,70
'Cause he knows me so well.

429
00:26:02,70 --> 00:26:04,16
And whose fault is that?

430
00:26:04,25 --> 00:26:05,33
Can I guess?

431
00:26:06,95 --> 00:26:10,50
Perhaps you'll study Uncle Harlo
with more energy in the future.

432
00:26:13,29 --> 00:26:15,41
What field is it
he thinks I should be pursuing?

433
00:26:15,50 --> 00:26:18,12
He said he wanted to think about it.

434
00:26:19,00 --> 00:26:23,29
I struggled with how best to describe
to him the events that have led us here.

435
00:26:24,41 --> 00:26:26,87
I told him how sorry you were
about what happened.

436
00:26:27,45 --> 00:26:32,45
I stressed that it was a large enough
mistake to be deeply educational.

437
00:26:32,45 --> 00:26:33,87
Yes, I heard some of that.

438
00:26:33,87 --> 00:26:35,12
Our conversation?

439
00:26:35,12 --> 00:26:36,33
Your side of it.

440
00:26:36,33 --> 00:26:37,41
Hard to miss.

441
00:26:38,79 --> 00:26:41,58
Sadly, I wasn't able
to study Uncle Harlo's response.

442
00:26:42,20 --> 00:26:44,25
He knows how much we're counting on him.

443
00:26:50,66 --> 00:26:52,58
Stairs to the hangar?

444
00:26:52,58 --> 00:26:54,54
Four flights, four landings.

445
00:26:54,62 --> 00:26:56,12
Vault cage weak point?

446
00:26:56,95 --> 00:26:58,50
Top corners.

447
00:26:58,50 --> 00:27:00,04
Distance to load ramp?

448
00:27:00,12 --> 00:27:01,54
Twenty-eight meters.

449
00:27:01,62 --> 00:27:03,04
Emergency comm signal?

450
00:27:03,66 --> 00:27:05,04
Red-Red.

451
00:27:05,12 --> 00:27:06,12
Clear signal?

452
00:27:06,12 --> 00:27:07,45
My turn.

453
00:27:07,45 --> 00:27:08,66
Lieutenant Gorn.

454
00:27:09,75 --> 00:27:12,87
What's an Imperial lieutenant doing
getting involved with this?

455
00:27:14,25 --> 00:27:15,70
What difference does it make?

456
00:27:16,45 --> 00:27:18,12
Everyone else seems to know.

457
00:27:21,91 --> 00:27:24,66
He fell in love with a local woman
and lost a promotion.

458
00:27:25,95 --> 00:27:27,12
Then he lost the woman.

459
00:27:28,08 --> 00:27:29,91
Then he lost his taste for the Empire.

460
00:27:31,83 --> 00:27:33,62
Everyone has their own rebellion.

461
00:27:46,00 --> 00:27:47,95
Is the shipment secure, sir?

462
00:27:47,95 --> 00:27:49,16
Attention!

463
00:27:53,50 --> 00:27:54,75
Sir.

464
00:27:54,75 --> 00:27:55,95
As you were.

465
00:27:57,16 --> 00:27:59,87
I prepared
a reduced schedule for tomorrow.

466
00:27:59,87 --> 00:28:03,25
- I know you were eager for that.
- It'll mean a great deal to the men.

467
00:28:03,25 --> 00:28:06,50
And now,
I see the gantry's still unpainted.

468
00:28:07,12 --> 00:28:08,50
I've spoken to them about it, sir.

469
00:28:08,50 --> 00:28:10,25
And yet it remains undone

470
00:28:10,25 --> 00:28:13,91
with an engineering officer from Coruscant
arriving today and in our business.

471
00:28:14,41 --> 00:28:17,70
Let's see if painting it tomorrow night
will make the point more clearly.

472
00:28:18,62 --> 00:28:19,62
Sir.

473
00:28:20,16 --> 00:28:21,62
May I speak plainly, sir?

474
00:28:21,62 --> 00:28:23,08
Plainly and quickly.

475
00:28:23,08 --> 00:28:24,16
Aldhani, sir.

476
00:28:24,95 --> 00:28:27,20
It's not many people's
first-choice assignment.

477
00:28:27,20 --> 00:28:29,25
The thing you hear when posted to Aldhani

478
00:28:29,25 --> 00:28:32,12
is that perhaps you'll be lucky enough
to be there for the Eye.

479
00:28:32,12 --> 00:28:34,16
The idea of being this close
and not seeing it,

480
00:28:34,25 --> 00:28:35,95
and I know we can't all be up there,

481
00:28:35,95 --> 00:28:38,29
but I fear morale might be crushed
by having anything more

482
00:28:38,37 --> 00:28:40,50
than an essential roster
down here tomorrow night.

483
00:28:43,87 --> 00:28:45,66
I want it painted the day after tomorrow.

484
00:28:45,75 --> 00:28:48,20
I'll be here midday,
and I expect to see it shine.

485
00:28:48,20 --> 00:28:49,70
- Absolutely, sir.
- Thank you, sir.

486
00:28:49,70 --> 00:28:51,79
Make sure the men know
how close they've come.

487
00:29:25,75 --> 00:29:27,16
Don't move.

488
00:29:28,08 --> 00:29:30,62
-'Cause you know what'll happen.
- Hey, what are you doing?

489
00:29:33,33 --> 00:29:34,41
There we go.

490
00:29:35,95 --> 00:29:37,00
I knew it.

491
00:29:37,45 --> 00:29:39,70
I knew you were lying. I knew it.

492
00:29:40,37 --> 00:29:41,58
- Look.
- What is it?

493
00:29:42,33 --> 00:29:43,50
Kyber.

494
00:29:43,50 --> 00:29:44,83
Sky kyber.

495
00:29:45,62 --> 00:29:46,66
He's been hiding it.

496
00:29:46,75 --> 00:29:47,75
Skeen?

497
00:29:47,75 --> 00:29:49,91
- Sky kyber. Look at it glow.
- What's going on?

498
00:29:50,00 --> 00:29:51,12
I warned you.

499
00:29:51,12 --> 00:29:53,87
He comes here with nothin'
but the clothes on his back

500
00:29:53,87 --> 00:29:56,08
and a stone worth 30,000 credits?

501
00:29:56,08 --> 00:29:58,54
- You have a problem, you come to me.
- Here I am.

502
00:29:58,62 --> 00:30:01,58
I've topped out on questions, Vel.
I have reached my limit.

503
00:30:01,58 --> 00:30:03,20
He won't say why he's here,

504
00:30:03,20 --> 00:30:04,29
where he's from.

505
00:30:04,37 --> 00:30:07,29
He doesn't say what he believes in.
And now this?

506
00:30:07,37 --> 00:30:09,58
Who brings a treasure to a robbery?

507
00:30:09,58 --> 00:30:11,41
We don't have time for this.

508
00:30:11,50 --> 00:30:13,70
I need to know who I'm riding with.

509
00:30:13,70 --> 00:30:15,45
You know exactly who I am.

510
00:30:16,04 --> 00:30:18,20
- And you know I'll kill you for it.
- Okay.

511
00:30:18,20 --> 00:30:20,58
Okay, so, I guess we know
it's not a fake, huh?

512
00:30:20,58 --> 00:30:23,70
- It's your call.
- Let's not go too far, Clem.

513
00:30:23,70 --> 00:30:26,16
- I just want what's mine.
- Yeah, don't put me on the spot.

514
00:30:26,25 --> 00:30:27,41
Enough!

515
00:30:27,50 --> 00:30:28,83
Everyone stands down.

516
00:30:29,66 --> 00:30:30,66
Everyone!

517
00:30:30,75 --> 00:30:33,54
There's something coming!
There's a... There's a ship in the valley!

518
00:30:33,62 --> 00:30:34,66
Get your packs up.

519
00:30:34,75 --> 00:30:36,04
Move!

520
00:30:36,12 --> 00:30:37,29
Put the weapon away.

521
00:30:37,37 --> 00:30:39,66
Give him the stone.
You can kill each other later.

522
00:30:41,87 --> 00:30:43,54
You'd be right where I am.

523
00:30:45,25 --> 00:30:46,79
Tell yourself whatever you want.

524
00:30:46,87 --> 00:30:48,33
I think we're okay!

525
00:30:48,33 --> 00:30:50,33
It's heading towards the garrison!

526
00:30:51,33 --> 00:30:52,91
Get your stuff! Move!

527
00:30:55,20 --> 00:30:56,95
We'll talk when we're safe.

528
00:31:05,50 --> 00:31:06,75
I'm being paid.

529
00:31:08,66 --> 00:31:09,70
Paid to be here.

530
00:31:11,33 --> 00:31:12,50
You need to know?

531
00:31:12,50 --> 00:31:13,66
That's it.

532
00:31:16,45 --> 00:31:19,16
- What?
- Yeah, I'm here for the money.

533
00:31:20,12 --> 00:31:21,54
You can't live with that?

534
00:31:21,62 --> 00:31:22,87
I'm not worth it?

535
00:31:22,87 --> 00:31:24,62
I'll walk away and wish you luck.

536
00:31:25,41 --> 00:31:26,87
But that's what it is.

537
00:31:28,00 --> 00:31:31,29
I don't want to walk in
looking over my shoulder.

538
00:31:32,50 --> 00:31:33,54
You knew this?

539
00:31:34,75 --> 00:31:37,25
The choice was take him or call it off.

540
00:31:37,25 --> 00:31:39,50
- Call it off?
- You should've told us days ago.

541
00:31:40,16 --> 00:31:41,16
Maybe so.

542
00:31:41,25 --> 00:31:42,91
It just would've been something else.

543
00:31:44,54 --> 00:31:45,62
What's that mean?

544
00:31:45,62 --> 00:31:47,62
The day before is always hard.

545
00:31:48,50 --> 00:31:50,16
Too much time to worry.

546
00:31:50,25 --> 00:31:51,45
You think we're scared?

547
00:31:51,45 --> 00:31:52,87
I know you are.

548
00:31:52,87 --> 00:31:54,29
It's really only the money?

549
00:31:54,87 --> 00:31:56,33
To take a risk like this?

550
00:31:56,33 --> 00:31:57,45
Come on.

551
00:31:57,45 --> 00:31:59,33
Maybe you're the one that's afraid.

552
00:31:59,33 --> 00:32:00,70
Of course I'm afraid.

553
00:32:01,29 --> 00:32:04,20
But there's a difference
between fear and losing your nerve.

554
00:32:04,20 --> 00:32:05,58
You want out of this?

555
00:32:06,16 --> 00:32:07,16
Make a choice.

556
00:32:07,25 --> 00:32:09,16
Don't use me as an excuse.

557
00:32:12,91 --> 00:32:14,12
Cinta?

558
00:32:14,79 --> 00:32:15,79
No.

559
00:32:16,75 --> 00:32:17,79
She didn't tell me.

560
00:32:22,45 --> 00:32:24,66
Let's get to the camp in one piece.

561
00:32:25,29 --> 00:32:27,08
You can all chew on it there.

562
00:32:27,91 --> 00:32:28,91
All of you.

563
00:32:30,62 --> 00:32:31,62
Move.

564
00:32:49,37 --> 00:32:51,08
You saw me talking to Gar Tafeed.

565
00:32:51,08 --> 00:32:52,91
Mmm. You were busy tonight.

566
00:32:53,79 --> 00:32:55,95
He knows more about
what you're up to than I do.

567
00:32:56,83 --> 00:32:58,50
Must be embarrassing.

568
00:32:59,45 --> 00:33:02,41
When were you planning to tell me
about this new foundation?

569
00:33:03,75 --> 00:33:06,66
Well, I didn't think you'd be interested.

570
00:33:08,16 --> 00:33:09,20
Why is that?

571
00:33:10,70 --> 00:33:11,79
It's charitable.

572
00:33:15,08 --> 00:33:16,08
Hmm.

573
00:33:19,50 --> 00:33:20,50
What's his name?

574
00:33:21,75 --> 00:33:22,79
Kloris.

575
00:33:24,75 --> 00:33:26,54
- Kloris?
- Sir?

576
00:33:27,29 --> 00:33:29,29
<i>Would you mind taking the Expressway?</i>

577
00:33:29,37 --> 00:33:30,41
Yes, sir.

578
00:33:59,16 --> 00:34:01,00
Looks just like your model.

579
00:34:01,00 --> 00:34:02,29
Should do.

580
00:34:02,37 --> 00:34:04,20
I've had plenty of time to study,

581
00:34:04,20 --> 00:34:06,45
and we've been
sneaking up here for months.

582
00:34:08,70 --> 00:34:10,12
We need to signal soon.

583
00:34:10,12 --> 00:34:11,83
Let's get a fire up. Let's go.

584
00:34:56,58 --> 00:34:58,45
Okay, that should do it.

585
00:35:06,45 --> 00:35:07,66
Skeen.

586
00:35:24,87 --> 00:35:27,04
She wants me to tell you about my brother.

587
00:35:29,16 --> 00:35:32,79
There's a long version,
but what matters is they killed him.

588
00:35:33,66 --> 00:35:34,75
He was a farmer.

589
00:35:35,79 --> 00:35:38,50
Imperial Prefect came in,
took his land, flooded it.

590
00:35:40,45 --> 00:35:41,62
He couldn't fight him.

591
00:35:42,95 --> 00:35:47,79
He couldn't bear it, so he went a boat
and filled his pockets with stones.

592
00:35:50,04 --> 00:35:52,41
I always hated the Empire.

593
00:35:54,45 --> 00:35:56,83
I don't really know
what to call how I feel now.

594
00:36:01,58 --> 00:36:02,75
What kind of farm?

595
00:36:04,54 --> 00:36:05,91
Trees.

596
00:36:06,00 --> 00:36:07,20
Pepper trees.

597
00:36:08,66 --> 00:36:09,91
Centuries of 'em.

598
00:36:14,79 --> 00:36:17,25
That's as close to an apology
as you're gonna get.

599
00:36:21,62 --> 00:36:22,87
It's close enough.

600
00:36:32,16 --> 00:36:33,58
Taramyn's in charge now.

601
00:36:34,54 --> 00:36:35,66
Completely in charge.

602
00:36:36,50 --> 00:36:37,95
I need to know you understand that.

603
00:36:38,54 --> 00:36:39,87
Where will you be?

604
00:36:39,87 --> 00:36:42,45
If all goes well,
we'll see you tomorrow night.

605
00:36:44,58 --> 00:36:47,20
I need to hear you tell me
you can follow the plan.

606
00:36:48,16 --> 00:36:49,91
You won't have a problem with me.

607
00:36:53,50 --> 00:36:54,66
Good luck to you.

608
00:36:56,08 --> 00:36:57,33
No farewells tonight.

609
00:36:58,08 --> 00:36:59,91
Plenty of work to do together tomorrow.

610
00:37:46,16 --> 00:37:47,75
I thought you were turning it off.

611
00:37:48,62 --> 00:37:49,79
I was just going to.

612
00:37:50,62 --> 00:37:52,33
You said that an hour ago.

613
00:37:52,33 --> 00:37:53,45
Am I keeping you up?

614
00:37:55,20 --> 00:37:57,00
There's nothing coming through tonight.

615
00:37:57,54 --> 00:37:59,87
You want to be useful,
go clean some coins.

616
00:38:06,79 --> 00:38:07,79
Happy?

617
00:38:13,16 --> 00:38:15,08
Have you checked your walk-away pack?

618
00:38:15,08 --> 00:38:17,08
- Yes.
- And the one on the Fondor?

619
00:38:17,08 --> 00:38:18,87
I don't like seeing you nervous.

620
00:38:22,04 --> 00:38:23,87
There's nothing else you can do, Luthen.

621
00:38:23,87 --> 00:38:26,37
They're either gonna be okay out there
or they're not.

622
00:38:26,37 --> 00:38:29,00
Well, that's a daring prediction.

623
00:38:29,00 --> 00:38:31,91
- Vel's the only one who traces back.
- No.

624
00:38:32,50 --> 00:38:34,08
The thief. Andor.

625
00:38:34,08 --> 00:38:35,41
I wasn't careful.

626
00:38:35,50 --> 00:38:37,29
You wanted this to happen.

627
00:38:38,04 --> 00:38:39,20
This is what it took.

628
00:38:39,91 --> 00:38:41,41
It's never gonna be perfect.

629
00:38:42,54 --> 00:38:43,87
I wanted it too much.

630
00:38:46,20 --> 00:38:47,79
We have clients in the morning.

631
00:38:48,87 --> 00:38:50,20
Yeah, I'll be ready.

632
00:38:52,66 --> 00:38:54,58
It'll all be over this time tomorrow.

633
00:38:57,33 --> 00:38:58,91
Or it'll just be starting.

634
00:39:01,00 --> 00:39:02,00
Or that.
