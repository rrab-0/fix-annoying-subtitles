1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:04,70
Wouldn't you rather give it all at once
to something real?

2
00:00:05,37 --> 00:00:07,20
What would we be stealing?

3
00:00:07,20 --> 00:00:10,91
The quarterly payroll
for an entire Imperial sector.

4
00:00:13,00 --> 00:00:15,62
That's why you're here? Revenge?

5
00:00:15,62 --> 00:00:17,58
Yeah, that's good enough for now.

6
00:00:17,58 --> 00:00:19,50
I didn't mark you for a team player.

7
00:00:19,50 --> 00:00:21,58
Working with other people is never easy.

8
00:00:23,00 --> 00:00:25,41
<i>We're taking crates of payroll
from that vault,</i>

9
00:00:25,50 --> 00:00:28,75
<i>loading the freighter,
and escaping out of the runway tunnel.</i>

10
00:00:28,75 --> 00:00:30,66
Escaping? In a Rono?

11
00:00:30,75 --> 00:00:32,87
You'll be lucky to make the horizon.

12
00:00:32,87 --> 00:00:34,62
No one's stupid enough to try it.

13
00:00:34,62 --> 00:00:36,29
No one but us.

14
00:00:36,87 --> 00:00:39,04
It's about confidence.
We belong here.

15
00:00:39,12 --> 00:00:40,20
We're followin' orders.

16
00:00:40,20 --> 00:00:41,87
Wait!

17
00:00:45,70 --> 00:00:48,66
Surprise from above
is never as shocking as one from below.

18
00:00:50,79 --> 00:00:52,33
Don't move.

19
00:00:52,33 --> 00:00:55,33
He comes here with nothin'
but the clothes on his back

20
00:00:55,33 --> 00:00:57,37
and a stone worth 30,000 credits?

21
00:00:57,37 --> 00:01:00,08
Who brings a treasure to a robbery?

22
00:01:00,08 --> 00:01:01,33
I'm being paid.

23
00:01:01,33 --> 00:01:03,00
You can't live with that?

24
00:01:03,00 --> 00:01:05,79
I don't wanna walk in
looking over my shoulder.

25
00:01:05,87 --> 00:01:07,75
<i>Looks just like your model.</i>

26
00:01:07,75 --> 00:01:09,20
Should do.

27
00:01:09,20 --> 00:01:11,08
I've had plenty of time to study,

28
00:01:11,08 --> 00:01:13,29
and we've been
sneaking up here for months.

29
00:01:14,16 --> 00:01:16,08
<i>There's nothing else
you can do, Luthen.</i>

30
00:01:16,08 --> 00:01:17,95
They're either gonna be okay or not.

31
00:01:17,95 --> 00:01:19,83
The thief. Andor.

32
00:01:19,83 --> 00:01:21,29
I wasn't careful.

33
00:01:21,37 --> 00:01:23,41
It'll all be over this time tomorrow.

34
00:01:24,08 --> 00:01:25,79
Or it'll just be starting.

35
00:02:53,12 --> 00:02:54,29
I couldn't sleep.

36
00:02:55,50 --> 00:02:56,50
It's natural.

37
00:02:57,33 --> 00:02:59,00
I need to be at my best.

38
00:02:59,00 --> 00:03:00,25
Don't worry.

39
00:03:01,20 --> 00:03:02,79
The excitement will kick in.

40
00:03:04,58 --> 00:03:07,16
I'm struggling to understand
why my faith doesn't calm me.

41
00:03:07,25 --> 00:03:09,25
I believe in something.
Why am I so unsettled?

42
00:03:09,25 --> 00:03:12,16
I mean, you have nothing,
you sleep like a stone.

43
00:03:13,25 --> 00:03:14,62
I write when I can't sleep.

44
00:03:15,54 --> 00:03:18,95
Wrote about you last night.
Not you specifically, not "Clem."

45
00:03:18,95 --> 00:03:22,04
Although I'm assuming
that's not your real name, anyway.

46
00:03:22,12 --> 00:03:25,33
"The Role of Mercenaries
in The Galactic Struggle for Freedom."

47
00:03:25,33 --> 00:03:27,29
My conclusion is simple.

48
00:03:27,37 --> 00:03:28,54
Weapons are tools.

49
00:03:28,62 --> 00:03:30,29
Those that use them are, by extension,

50
00:03:30,37 --> 00:03:32,58
assets that we must use
to our best advantage.

51
00:03:32,58 --> 00:03:34,16
The Empire has no moral boundaries,

52
00:03:34,25 --> 00:03:36,87
why should we not take hold
of every chance we can?

53
00:03:36,87 --> 00:03:39,45
Let them see how an insurgency adapts.

54
00:03:40,70 --> 00:03:44,04
Well, you're half right.

55
00:03:44,79 --> 00:03:46,95
The Empire doesn't play by the rules.

56
00:03:47,87 --> 00:03:49,45
And how am I wrong?

57
00:03:53,45 --> 00:03:55,37
They don't care enough to learn.

58
00:03:58,16 --> 00:03:59,25
They don't have to.

59
00:04:00,37 --> 00:04:01,95
You mean nothing to them.

60
00:04:04,08 --> 00:04:06,41
Perhaps they'll think
differently tomorrow.

61
00:04:07,04 --> 00:04:08,50
Be careful what you wish for.

62
00:04:08,50 --> 00:04:10,45
So you think it's hopeless, do you?

63
00:04:11,29 --> 00:04:14,16
Freedom? Independence? Justice?

64
00:04:15,08 --> 00:04:17,04
We should just submit and be thankful?

65
00:04:17,12 --> 00:04:18,37
Just take what we're given?

66
00:04:20,45 --> 00:04:22,58
Do I look thankful to you?

67
00:04:24,00 --> 00:04:25,29
No.

68
00:04:26,87 --> 00:04:28,37
But I'm glad that you're here.

69
00:04:29,54 --> 00:04:31,00
No matter what the reason.

70
00:04:33,00 --> 00:04:34,50
Don't worry.

71
00:04:34,50 --> 00:04:36,04
You'll be fine.

72
00:04:36,70 --> 00:04:38,29
You'll sleep when it's done.

73
00:04:45,50 --> 00:04:47,79
The Dhanis, they're a simple people.

74
00:04:49,20 --> 00:04:51,62
They breed a sad combination of traits

75
00:04:51,62 --> 00:04:54,29
that make them particularly vulnerable
to manipulation.

76
00:04:55,75 --> 00:04:57,25
<i>On a practical level,</i>

77
00:04:57,25 --> 00:05:00,37
<i>they have great difficulty holding
multiple ideas simultaneously.</i>

78
00:05:01,54 --> 00:05:05,87
We've found the best way to steer them
as we'd like is to offer alternatives.

79
00:05:05,87 --> 00:05:10,37
You put a number of options on the table,
and they're so wrapped up in choosing,

80
00:05:10,37 --> 00:05:12,87
they fail to notice
you've given them nothing

81
00:05:12,87 --> 00:05:14,62
they thought they wanted at the start.

82
00:05:16,62 --> 00:05:18,62
<i>Their deeper problem is pride.</i>

83
00:05:18,62 --> 00:05:22,75
<i>The Dhanis would rather lose,
they'd rather suffer, than accept.</i>

84
00:05:22,75 --> 00:05:24,58
<i>Which is wildly ironic</i>

85
00:05:24,58 --> 00:05:27,00
<i>as they've choked down
everything we've thrown at them</i>

86
00:05:27,00 --> 00:05:28,20
<i>these last 12 years.</i>

87
00:05:28,20 --> 00:05:31,16
<i>It's a ten-day trek up from the Lowlands.</i>

88
00:05:31,25 --> 00:05:33,87
<i>We offered them a transport
because we know they'll refuse,</i>

89
00:05:33,87 --> 00:05:37,45
but then, along the way,
we've placed a series of "Comfort Units,"

90
00:05:37,45 --> 00:05:41,62
shelters and taverns
with cheap local beverages.

91
00:05:41,62 --> 00:05:43,20
Quite predictably,

92
00:05:43,20 --> 00:05:48,75
what began as 500 pilgrims at the bottom
has already dwindled down to...

93
00:05:48,75 --> 00:05:51,87
- Where are we now, Lieutenant?
- We counted 60 last night, sir.

94
00:05:51,87 --> 00:05:54,37
They may pick up
some highland stragglers along the way,

95
00:05:54,37 --> 00:05:56,08
but it's developing as we'd expected.

96
00:05:56,08 --> 00:05:59,87
Not that long ago,
they'd put 15,000 out there.

97
00:06:00,70 --> 00:06:03,79
Have they any idea this is the last time
they'll be allowed up here?

98
00:06:03,87 --> 00:06:05,58
No, there's no profit in that.

99
00:06:05,58 --> 00:06:09,08
We've spent the last decade promoting
an Imperial viewing festival

100
00:06:09,08 --> 00:06:10,58
down in the Enterprise Zone.

101
00:06:10,58 --> 00:06:12,25
They'll have that going forward.

102
00:06:12,25 --> 00:06:15,37
It is their sacred valley, is it not?

103
00:06:15,37 --> 00:06:18,04
Well, ultimately, they will return,
won't they, Colonel?

104
00:06:18,12 --> 00:06:21,66
When you need plenty of arms and legs
to build all you've got planned.

105
00:06:22,95 --> 00:06:25,33
You've been here the longest,
haven't you, Lieutenant?

106
00:06:25,33 --> 00:06:27,08
Yes, sir. Seven years.

107
00:06:27,08 --> 00:06:29,87
Will the Dhanis let us build
our new facility in peace?

108
00:06:30,83 --> 00:06:32,54
I don't see them having a choice.

109
00:06:33,70 --> 00:06:36,41
The Eye, Colonel, you're in for a treat.

110
00:06:37,25 --> 00:06:38,95
It really is something to see.

111
00:06:39,87 --> 00:06:42,16
Quite the celestial spectacle.

112
00:06:43,12 --> 00:06:44,54
I'm looking forward to it.

113
00:07:01,33 --> 00:07:02,79
Now, what do you make of him?

114
00:07:03,62 --> 00:07:04,66
Colonel Petigar?

115
00:07:05,87 --> 00:07:08,25
He's an engineer. You won't charm him.

116
00:07:09,04 --> 00:07:11,04
Well, it won't be for lack of trying.

117
00:07:11,12 --> 00:07:12,12
Are we secure?

118
00:07:12,79 --> 00:07:16,16
I've brought in 30 sentries from Alkenzi.
I'll be supervising them.

119
00:07:16,25 --> 00:07:18,25
I've sent our best men to the perimeters.

120
00:07:18,25 --> 00:07:20,33
- Tonight must be perfect.
- That's the plan, sir.

121
00:07:20,33 --> 00:07:21,41
Perfect.

122
00:07:21,50 --> 00:07:23,50
I want that word ringing in your ears.

123
00:07:25,95 --> 00:07:27,04
<i>Echo-One.</i>

124
00:07:27,75 --> 00:07:28,87
Echo-One.

125
00:07:30,08 --> 00:07:31,37
Echo-One.

126
00:07:31,37 --> 00:07:33,04
Echo-One on spot.

127
00:07:33,12 --> 00:07:34,16
Echo-One.

128
00:07:34,25 --> 00:07:36,08
- Go ten up.
- What is that?

129
00:07:36,75 --> 00:07:39,70
Fieldcomm. It's a battle radio.

130
00:07:40,83 --> 00:07:42,20
Looks Imperial.

131
00:07:42,20 --> 00:07:43,41
Not anymore.

132
00:07:43,50 --> 00:07:45,04
Echo-One.

133
00:07:45,12 --> 00:07:46,87
- Echo-One.
- Go three up.

134
00:07:46,87 --> 00:07:48,16
What? It's not working?

135
00:07:48,83 --> 00:07:50,29
It will. It locks in.

136
00:07:50,37 --> 00:07:53,91
When it does, it will carry on working
long after everything else is fried.

137
00:07:54,00 --> 00:07:55,87
 <i>Valley-One. Valley-One.</i>

138
00:07:55,87 --> 00:07:58,33
<i>Valley-One, go. Valley-One.</i>

139
00:07:58,33 --> 00:08:00,54
Valley-One. Valley-One on spot.

140
00:08:00,62 --> 00:08:02,29
Valley-One. Valley-One.

141
00:08:02,95 --> 00:08:04,91
<i>Echo engaged. Lockin' now.</i>

142
00:08:05,95 --> 00:08:09,41
Lock and confirm, Echo. Lock and confirm.

143
00:08:10,95 --> 00:08:12,41
Confirm. We're locked in.

144
00:08:13,08 --> 00:08:14,29
<i>We're dialed in.</i>

145
00:08:14,37 --> 00:08:16,29
<i>Movin' now.</i>

146
00:08:16,37 --> 00:08:17,45
Safe travels.

147
00:08:18,41 --> 00:08:19,54
<i>And to you.</i>

148
00:08:19,62 --> 00:08:20,83
Valley-One out.

149
00:08:25,70 --> 00:08:26,95
Let's pick it up.

150
00:08:27,83 --> 00:08:28,91
Fallin' behind.

151
00:08:30,83 --> 00:08:32,62
He likes giving orders, doesn't he?

152
00:08:34,04 --> 00:08:35,45
Makes sense, right?

153
00:08:36,16 --> 00:08:38,37
What do you mean?

154
00:08:38,83 --> 00:08:40,58
They didn't tell you, did they?

155
00:08:46,12 --> 00:08:47,45
He was a stormtrooper.

156
00:08:49,37 --> 00:08:50,58
Really?

157
00:08:52,95 --> 00:08:54,12
Pick it up!

158
00:08:55,83 --> 00:08:57,83
You should've been here
when Cinta found out.

159
00:08:58,75 --> 00:09:00,45
They slaughtered her whole family.

160
00:09:01,29 --> 00:09:02,33
Pick it up.

161
00:09:32,37 --> 00:09:33,66
Has it started?

162
00:09:33,75 --> 00:09:36,37
Well, the Dhanis
don't believe it ever ends.

163
00:09:36,37 --> 00:09:38,79
So, yes, sir, it has definitely started.

164
00:09:39,45 --> 00:09:40,45
Gorn here. Go ahead.

165
00:09:40,45 --> 00:09:42,12
<i>Low Road Unit reporting, sir.</i>

166
00:09:42,12 --> 00:09:43,54
The guests are arriving.

167
00:09:44,20 --> 00:09:46,04
<i>Let's have a peaceful welcome.</i>

168
00:09:46,70 --> 00:09:47,91
Will do, sir.

169
00:09:48,00 --> 00:09:49,00
Form up!

170
00:09:49,00 --> 00:09:50,58
But do it quietly.

171
00:10:01,62 --> 00:10:03,33
<i>Tighten up. Eyes front.</i>

172
00:10:04,25 --> 00:10:05,91
<i>They'll be here any minute.</i>

173
00:10:06,00 --> 00:10:07,54
<i>You're a soldier now, Clem.</i>

174
00:10:08,50 --> 00:10:10,16
<i>These people hate us.</i>

175
00:10:10,25 --> 00:10:13,00
<i>The ones that have climbed this far
have made a life of it.</i>

176
00:10:13,00 --> 00:10:14,62
<i>Do not engage.</i>

177
00:10:14,62 --> 00:10:17,50
We meet soldiers from the garrison?
We're from Alkenzi.

178
00:10:17,50 --> 00:10:19,79
They're from Alkenzi?
We're from the garrison.

179
00:10:20,45 --> 00:10:23,41
Keep your mouths shut,
and remember, we belong here.

180
00:10:25,50 --> 00:10:28,25
It might be best
if we split these up between us, and...

181
00:10:28,25 --> 00:10:31,95
SOLDIER 1: Hysterical.
I said, "You can't both be right."

182
00:10:45,83 --> 00:10:48,12
They're just gonna be
waiting for him, right?

183
00:10:49,04 --> 00:10:50,91
I had a good look at her.

184
00:10:51,00 --> 00:10:54,91
Believe me, patience was not
the first thing that came to mind.

185
00:11:00,29 --> 00:11:02,08
SOLDIER 2: Oi, here comes another one.

186
00:11:03,50 --> 00:11:04,50
Whoo!

187
00:11:07,70 --> 00:11:08,91
Oh, look at that.

188
00:11:11,41 --> 00:11:12,79
SOLDIER 1: Come on.

189
00:11:12,87 --> 00:11:14,33
Let's get back to base.

190
00:11:23,58 --> 00:11:25,45
Escort, march!

191
00:11:48,87 --> 00:11:49,95
Roboda?

192
00:11:51,91 --> 00:11:53,79
- Roboda.
- I'm dressing Leonart.

193
00:11:53,87 --> 00:11:55,87
He's 12, he can dress himself.

194
00:11:55,87 --> 00:11:57,54
Come and look at this sash.

195
00:11:58,29 --> 00:11:59,87
None of this was stored properly.

196
00:11:59,87 --> 00:12:01,00
It's all compressed.

197
00:12:01,00 --> 00:12:02,45
Perhaps you've expanded.

198
00:12:06,20 --> 00:12:07,91
Where's his Imperial blouse?

199
00:12:08,00 --> 00:12:09,12
I'm not wearing that.

200
00:12:09,12 --> 00:12:10,66
You'll do as you're told.

201
00:12:10,75 --> 00:12:12,62
Mother, I don't feel well.

202
00:12:12,62 --> 00:12:15,62
You'll make an effort tonight
if it kills you.

203
00:12:15,62 --> 00:12:16,87
He might have a fever.

204
00:12:16,87 --> 00:12:20,16
- He might feel the back of my hand.
- The boy is ill, Jayhold.

205
00:12:20,25 --> 00:12:22,00
He's always ill.

206
00:12:24,25 --> 00:12:26,41
Look, you wanna get out of here, do you?

207
00:12:27,08 --> 00:12:29,04
Get that transfer,
leave this stinking planet?

208
00:12:29,12 --> 00:12:30,58
You certainly whine about it enough.

209
00:12:30,58 --> 00:12:33,20
Colonel Petigar
will be making those decisions.

210
00:12:33,20 --> 00:12:36,16
Now, I want everyone
on their best behavior this evening.

211
00:12:36,25 --> 00:12:38,12
I look forward to seeing that.

212
00:12:52,20 --> 00:12:53,91
Company, halt!

213
00:13:04,75 --> 00:13:06,66
Squad, halt!

214
00:13:23,41 --> 00:13:24,58
Let them pass.

215
00:13:31,58 --> 00:13:33,04
Quick, march!

216
00:13:55,33 --> 00:13:57,62
{\an8}Get ready. I think I hear two coming.

217
00:14:09,20 --> 00:14:10,29
Let's go.

218
00:14:20,95 --> 00:14:22,87
You were right.

219
00:14:23,12 --> 00:14:24,41
I'm not tired at all.

220
00:14:25,37 --> 00:14:26,37
Tighten up.

221
00:14:26,91 --> 00:14:28,50
All right, listen up!

222
00:14:30,45 --> 00:14:33,87
Squads One, Two, and Four,
you're here for the night.

223
00:14:33,87 --> 00:14:35,08
Get comfortable.

224
00:14:35,08 --> 00:14:36,29
I want no surprises.

225
00:14:37,58 --> 00:14:39,50
Squad Three, standby.

226
00:14:40,16 --> 00:14:43,83
You'll be joining the return escort
with the Commandant and his family.

227
00:14:48,87 --> 00:14:51,95
If you don't bother them,
they won't bother you.

228
00:14:51,95 --> 00:14:54,29
So I want mouths shut and eyes open.

229
00:14:55,62 --> 00:14:56,91
Corporal.

230
00:14:57,00 --> 00:14:58,04
Right turn.

231
00:14:59,04 --> 00:15:00,37
With me.

232
00:15:13,70 --> 00:15:15,04
Squad, halt!

233
00:15:35,87 --> 00:15:37,00
Everybody ready?

234
00:15:37,45 --> 00:15:39,20
Ah, the skin?

235
00:15:40,45 --> 00:15:42,62
We trade goat hides
for a three-year lease.

236
00:15:42,62 --> 00:15:45,08
If they didn't smell so badly,
it might be amusing.

237
00:15:45,08 --> 00:15:46,50
Come on, you two.

238
00:15:46,50 --> 00:15:49,04
The Dhanis have a rough appetite
for fragrance.

239
00:15:49,12 --> 00:15:50,37
Yes, I've been warned.

240
00:15:50,37 --> 00:15:54,04
A bit of ceremonial nonsense,
and we can tuck into a fine table.

241
00:15:54,12 --> 00:15:55,87
Above the stench.

242
00:16:07,66 --> 00:16:09,08
Has she checked in?

243
00:16:09,08 --> 00:16:10,20
Not yet.

244
00:16:11,37 --> 00:16:12,37
Problem?

245
00:16:13,58 --> 00:16:14,91
She'll be there.

246
00:16:20,87 --> 00:16:22,29
Wrong time to mess up.

247
00:16:22,37 --> 00:16:23,62
They were supposed to call us!

248
00:16:23,62 --> 00:16:25,91
- When are you gonna learn?
- SOLDIER 1: We were waiting!

249
00:16:26,00 --> 00:16:27,29
You were waiting?

250
00:16:27,37 --> 00:16:28,70
That's your excuse?

251
00:16:29,91 --> 00:16:31,29
You should know better.

252
00:16:32,33 --> 00:16:34,04
Don't let Gorn catch you.

253
00:16:34,12 --> 00:16:35,50
<i>Alkenzi Wing Seven.</i>

254
00:16:35,50 --> 00:16:37,12
<i>Eastern sweep completed.</i>

255
00:16:37,12 --> 00:16:38,25
<i>Returning to base.</i>

256
00:16:51,50 --> 00:16:52,66
Attention!

257
00:16:54,70 --> 00:16:55,70
Corporal.

258
00:16:56,37 --> 00:16:57,41
Sir.

259
00:17:01,45 --> 00:17:03,25
These men from Alkenzi?

260
00:17:04,12 --> 00:17:05,45
Yes, sir.

261
00:17:10,91 --> 00:17:14,16
- You do the talking, eh?
- Yes, sir.

262
00:17:14,25 --> 00:17:15,87
Let's make quick work of it.

263
00:17:42,83 --> 00:17:44,45
Where is she? We're late.

264
00:17:45,91 --> 00:17:47,70
Random.

265
00:17:50,37 --> 00:17:51,95
Alkenzi?

266
00:17:51,95 --> 00:17:53,87
No, they're shutting down right now.

267
00:17:54,70 --> 00:17:56,45
Everything's grounded.

268
00:17:56,45 --> 00:17:58,20
No one wants to be up in this.

269
00:18:03,16 --> 00:18:04,70
Vel, get down.

270
00:18:31,41 --> 00:18:32,41
It's solid?

271
00:18:33,08 --> 00:18:34,12
Call them.

272
00:18:34,12 --> 00:18:35,41
You're sure?

273
00:18:35,50 --> 00:18:36,62
You're stalling.

274
00:18:36,62 --> 00:18:38,08
 <i>Echo-One.</i>

275
00:18:38,66 --> 00:18:39,70
<i>Echo-One.</i>

276
00:18:39,70 --> 00:18:41,62
<i>Echo-One. Echo.</i>

277
00:18:42,79 --> 00:18:43,79
Echo-One.

278
00:18:46,75 --> 00:18:48,00
<i>Echo-One.</i>

279
00:18:49,41 --> 00:18:50,83
<i>Echo-One.</i>

280
00:18:50,83 --> 00:18:51,91
Valley-One.

281
00:18:52,00 --> 00:18:53,29
<i>Valley-One at go.</i>

282
00:18:54,08 --> 00:18:55,08
Call it.

283
00:18:56,41 --> 00:18:57,79
Are you on point?

284
00:18:57,87 --> 00:18:59,04
<i>Yes.</i>

285
00:18:59,12 --> 00:19:01,62
<i>We're here on point.</i>

286
00:19:04,54 --> 00:19:06,29
Are we going or not?

287
00:19:09,58 --> 00:19:10,79
Vel.

288
00:19:13,45 --> 00:19:14,45
Go.

289
00:19:15,00 --> 00:19:16,08
<i>We go.</i>

290
00:19:16,08 --> 00:19:17,16
Copy.

291
00:19:24,87 --> 00:19:28,41
He says,
"May The Eye find the good in all of us."

292
00:19:29,12 --> 00:19:30,54
Indeed.

293
00:19:31,62 --> 00:19:35,54
Tell him we'll give him the gift
of our absence and be on our way.

294
00:19:54,83 --> 00:19:57,16
- Corporal.
- At your service.

295
00:19:58,66 --> 00:20:00,00
Fall in.

296
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,00
Right turn.

297
00:20:03,58 --> 00:20:04,70
With me.

298
00:20:34,20 --> 00:20:35,33
Sir.

299
00:20:39,29 --> 00:20:41,08
- Everything in order?
- Yes, sir.

300
00:20:41,08 --> 00:20:43,25
You take the point
and send your men down.

301
00:20:43,25 --> 00:20:45,20
I want no one up here
without my permission.

302
00:20:45,20 --> 00:20:46,45
Will do, sir.

303
00:20:46,45 --> 00:20:50,16
You know, it's the old ones
causing all the problems.

304
00:20:51,04 --> 00:20:54,54
Always trying to...

305
00:21:04,12 --> 00:21:06,00
It'll all be much easier.

306
00:21:06,00 --> 00:21:07,95
The days of passing skins

307
00:21:07,95 --> 00:21:09,87
and ritual nonsense
will be soon behind us.

308
00:21:09,87 --> 00:21:10,95
No great loss there.

309
00:21:11,50 --> 00:21:13,70
It's not as if
there's much Aldhani civilization

310
00:21:13,70 --> 00:21:16,12
to even forget about in the first place.

311
00:21:16,12 --> 00:21:18,37
- Drop it. On the floor.
- What's all this?

312
00:21:18,37 --> 00:21:20,41
- No!
- Drop it there.

313
00:21:22,04 --> 00:21:23,45
Where's Lieutenant Gorn?

314
00:21:23,45 --> 00:21:25,20
Down, on the ground. Down.

315
00:21:25,20 --> 00:21:27,75
- What's the meaning of this?
- Be quiet!

316
00:21:29,87 --> 00:21:31,16
- Move.
- Please.

317
00:21:31,25 --> 00:21:33,75
- This is an outrage!
- Quiet! Stop talking!

318
00:21:33,75 --> 00:21:35,25
Stop right there.

319
00:21:40,25 --> 00:21:41,45
Let the boy go.

320
00:21:43,45 --> 00:21:46,83
- Let the boy go!
- Jayhold...

321
00:21:47,79 --> 00:21:49,16
Colonel, please.

322
00:21:49,83 --> 00:21:51,29
Nobody has to die.

323
00:22:03,75 --> 00:22:05,37
Everything all right, sir?

324
00:22:05,37 --> 00:22:06,70
All good.

325
00:22:06,70 --> 00:22:09,54
You can join your men
at the bottom of the hill now.

326
00:22:09,62 --> 00:22:11,00
Enjoy the Eye.

327
00:22:11,00 --> 00:22:12,41
Yes, sir.

328
00:22:12,50 --> 00:22:13,62
Thank you, sir.

329
00:22:14,62 --> 00:22:15,91
You'll never get out of here.

330
00:22:19,62 --> 00:22:20,62
We're good.

331
00:22:32,87 --> 00:22:35,79
- You do everything they tell you.
- Just what are you after?

332
00:22:35,87 --> 00:22:37,70
You'll be taking us
to the payroll vault.

333
00:22:37,70 --> 00:22:39,37
- That's insane.
- Or we die together.

334
00:22:39,37 --> 00:22:41,08
- I can't open the vault.
- Time check.

335
00:22:42,70 --> 00:22:44,95
- Falling behind.
- Go. We'll finish.

336
00:22:44,95 --> 00:22:46,37
Didn't you hear me?

337
00:22:46,37 --> 00:22:48,25
I don't control the vault!

338
00:22:48,25 --> 00:22:49,87
It's on a code from the air base.

339
00:22:49,87 --> 00:22:50,95
It's done remotely.

340
00:22:50,95 --> 00:22:53,29
Keep lying
and it'll be a short night for you.

341
00:22:53,37 --> 00:22:54,95
We know how the vault works.

342
00:22:54,95 --> 00:22:56,95
We need your hand to key the sensor.

343
00:22:56,95 --> 00:22:58,66
We can take just that if you'd prefer.

344
00:22:58,75 --> 00:23:00,12
You'll never make it out.

345
00:23:00,12 --> 00:23:02,66
- You better pray we do.
- You have no idea...

346
00:23:02,75 --> 00:23:04,70
One path! One choice.

347
00:23:04,70 --> 00:23:07,00
We win, or everyone dies.

348
00:23:07,00 --> 00:23:08,33
Starts now.

349
00:23:13,08 --> 00:23:14,87
Jayhold, please just do what they say.

350
00:23:39,45 --> 00:23:40,75
Welcome, sir.

351
00:23:40,75 --> 00:23:42,04
Put them down.

352
00:23:42,12 --> 00:23:43,12
Down!

353
00:23:43,83 --> 00:23:45,12
Against the wall. Move.

354
00:23:45,12 --> 00:23:46,20
Move!

355
00:23:46,20 --> 00:23:47,29
Down.

356
00:23:48,50 --> 00:23:50,83
Sorry, just having a problem
with the comms.

357
00:23:50,83 --> 00:23:52,37
Try the inverse channel.

358
00:23:52,37 --> 00:23:53,70
Hands away from the console.

359
00:23:54,37 --> 00:23:56,08
Get up, now!

360
00:24:05,50 --> 00:24:07,00
Move!

361
00:24:07,00 --> 00:24:08,75
Let's go! Move!

362
00:24:40,91 --> 00:24:44,79
Lights. Parapet.
Base Floods. Turrets. Launch Tunnel.

363
00:24:44,87 --> 00:24:46,66
Comms, you know.

364
00:24:46,75 --> 00:24:48,04
This?

365
00:24:48,12 --> 00:24:51,08
Don't touch, that's Alkenzi,
that's the Air Base Link.

366
00:24:51,08 --> 00:24:52,25
You're coming with us.

367
00:24:52,25 --> 00:24:53,37
Everyone else stays here.

368
00:24:54,00 --> 00:24:55,58
Your comms have been disabled.

369
00:24:55,58 --> 00:24:56,70
Ours are working.

370
00:24:56,70 --> 00:24:59,20
If you don't help us,
your family will die.

371
00:25:00,08 --> 00:25:02,29
If you slow us down,
if you stall, if you argue,

372
00:25:02,37 --> 00:25:04,79
if you play us in anyway, they will die.

373
00:25:04,87 --> 00:25:06,33
You'll kill us anyway.

374
00:25:06,33 --> 00:25:08,33
'Cause that's what you'd do, right?

375
00:25:08,33 --> 00:25:09,58
No.

376
00:25:09,58 --> 00:25:12,45
If we get what we came for,
everyone walks away.

377
00:25:13,12 --> 00:25:15,16
But if we go down,
you're right there with us.

378
00:25:15,25 --> 00:25:16,79
- 14 minutes.
- Move.

379
00:25:25,91 --> 00:25:27,25
Tell me you'll be all right.

380
00:25:28,70 --> 00:25:29,95
I'll be fine.

381
00:25:31,08 --> 00:25:32,16
Go.

382
00:25:46,87 --> 00:25:49,25
Are you having trouble with your comms?

383
00:25:49,25 --> 00:25:51,00
It just went down.

384
00:25:51,00 --> 00:25:54,83
The Alkenzi line is still open,
but everything else is fried.

385
00:25:54,83 --> 00:25:55,91
Weird, right?

386
00:25:56,00 --> 00:25:57,25
Must be the Eye.

387
00:26:03,16 --> 00:26:04,50
Clem out first.

388
00:26:15,62 --> 00:26:16,75
Clear.

389
00:26:16,75 --> 00:26:18,37
Vel, take him.

390
00:26:18,37 --> 00:26:19,58
Move.

391
00:26:19,58 --> 00:26:20,79
Clem, with me.

392
00:26:26,04 --> 00:26:27,70
- GUARD 1: Forty credits.
- GUARD 2: I'm in.

393
00:26:27,70 --> 00:26:28,79
GUARD 3: Deal.

394
00:26:29,66 --> 00:26:30,66
Hexba.

395
00:26:31,29 --> 00:26:32,66
GUARD 4: Hexa.

396
00:26:32,75 --> 00:26:33,95
GUARD 5: Hoxla.

397
00:26:33,95 --> 00:26:35,62
- GUARD 1: Come on.
- GUARD 6: Oh, come on.

398
00:26:45,95 --> 00:26:47,58
Commandant on the floor!

399
00:26:49,00 --> 00:26:50,25
Commandant inspection!

400
00:26:50,25 --> 00:26:51,87
- Muster up! Let's go.
- GUARD 1: Yes, sir.

401
00:26:51,87 --> 00:26:53,04
Line it up!

402
00:26:54,37 --> 00:26:55,37
Move!

403
00:26:56,12 --> 00:26:57,45
Hands on heads!

404
00:26:57,45 --> 00:26:59,04
Hands on your heads!

405
00:27:02,16 --> 00:27:03,20
Drop it! Now!

406
00:27:03,20 --> 00:27:05,08
- Out! Out!
- This is not an inspection,

407
00:27:05,08 --> 00:27:06,58
- it is a robbery!
- Move!

408
00:27:06,58 --> 00:27:08,66
They've taken
the tower and communications.

409
00:27:08,75 --> 00:27:10,95
They're holding hostages,
including my wife and son.

410
00:27:10,95 --> 00:27:12,04
Move!

411
00:27:12,12 --> 00:27:15,12
They've already killed, and I am sure
that they will do so again,

412
00:27:15,12 --> 00:27:18,04
which is why I am urging you to cooperate.

413
00:27:18,12 --> 00:27:20,41
Enough! Move! Move!

414
00:27:25,12 --> 00:27:26,12
Hey!

415
00:27:27,87 --> 00:27:30,66
You are gonna load us out
as fast as possible.

416
00:27:31,00 --> 00:27:34,25
Anyone doesn't want to hustle
for the next ten minutes, raise your hand.

417
00:27:34,91 --> 00:27:38,29
All right, up! Up! Up! Up! Let's go!

418
00:27:38,75 --> 00:27:40,29
Two men to a trolley. Let's go!

419
00:27:40,37 --> 00:27:41,62
You got power?

420
00:27:41,91 --> 00:27:43,41
Yeah, I do indeed.

421
00:27:44,41 --> 00:27:45,83
Let's go! Move! Move! Move!

422
00:28:03,75 --> 00:28:06,25
I can't unlock the trays.
It takes a signal from Alkenzi.

423
00:28:06,25 --> 00:28:08,54
- Get with the others.
- I only control the gate!

424
00:28:08,62 --> 00:28:10,29
- Move!
- They won't open!

425
00:28:10,95 --> 00:28:13,41
Do you hear me?
I don't control the vault!

426
00:28:14,12 --> 00:28:15,12
Get ready.

427
00:28:15,12 --> 00:28:16,33
Fire in the hole!

428
00:28:23,04 --> 00:28:24,04
They're in.

429
00:28:24,12 --> 00:28:26,54
Go. I'm almost done.
I'll be right behind you.

430
00:28:34,29 --> 00:28:36,45
Let's go!

431
00:28:37,00 --> 00:28:40,83
- Let's go! You, here! Move, move! Move!
- You, up there! Move! You up there!

432
00:28:41,62 --> 00:28:45,79
 <i>Echo-One. Echo-One,
on spot. Echo-One. Echo-One, on spot.</i>

433
00:28:45,87 --> 00:28:47,25
Valley-One. Loud and clear.

434
00:28:47,62 --> 00:28:50,25
<i>We've taken the vault
and breached the vault door...</i>

435
00:28:50,66 --> 00:28:54,79
<i>In... Repeat. We're in...
the freighter now.</i>

436
00:28:55,25 --> 00:28:56,79
<i>Copy that. All good up here.</i>

437
00:28:57,87 --> 00:29:00,25
<i>Get ready.
Alkenzi should be calling in soon.</i>

438
00:29:00,83 --> 00:29:02,62
<i>Will do. Valley-One out.</i>

439
00:29:12,33 --> 00:29:14,29
Come on!

440
00:29:14,37 --> 00:29:15,37
Come on!

441
00:29:15,37 --> 00:29:16,75
- Load!
- Out of the way!

442
00:29:16,75 --> 00:29:19,12
- Come on! All the way around!
- Move! Bring it in!

443
00:29:19,12 --> 00:29:21,41
Get it turned around! Move! Move!

444
00:29:21,50 --> 00:29:23,37
You're taking too long!
Let's go! Let's go!

445
00:29:23,37 --> 00:29:25,83
- Go! Get out! Out! Out! Okay!
- Come on!

446
00:29:25,83 --> 00:29:29,66
- Faster! Get it round and moving!
- Move! Move! Come on, move!

447
00:29:31,12 --> 00:29:33,50
 <i>Tower One,
this is Alkenzi Wing Command.</i>

448
00:29:33,83 --> 00:29:35,20
<i>Requesting status rep.</i>

449
00:29:36,08 --> 00:29:38,33
<i>We have a vault-breach indicator
lighting up over here.</i>

450
00:29:52,16 --> 00:29:53,83
<i>Tower One, please respond.</i>

451
00:29:54,12 --> 00:29:57,29
<i>A vault-breach indicator light
has gone off, and we need clari...</i>

452
00:30:16,37 --> 00:30:17,95
Where are we going?

453
00:30:17,95 --> 00:30:19,04
Heading to the vault.

454
00:30:19,12 --> 00:30:20,29
But we'll miss the Eye.

455
00:30:20,37 --> 00:30:21,62
Move! Let's go!

456
00:30:25,91 --> 00:30:27,75
- Let's go! Move! Move! Move!
- Move!

457
00:30:28,29 --> 00:30:30,20
Bring 'em in, bring 'em in. Keep loading!

458
00:30:30,20 --> 00:30:32,62
- Come on!
- Now! Now!

459
00:30:32,79 --> 00:30:33,95
Move, move, move!

460
00:30:34,45 --> 00:30:35,83
All right! Move! Let's go!

461
00:30:35,83 --> 00:30:37,29
- Keep moving!
- Come on!

462
00:30:38,29 --> 00:30:39,75
- Go, go, go!
- Move it!

463
00:30:41,20 --> 00:30:42,70
- Get out of here.
- Keep loadin'!

464
00:30:44,70 --> 00:30:45,95
- Let's go!
- Faster!

465
00:30:45,95 --> 00:30:47,75
- Come on.
- Move! Move!

466
00:30:47,75 --> 00:30:50,00
- Come on! Faster! Move!
- Move!

467
00:30:50,25 --> 00:30:51,62
- Get loading!
- Get it on. Come on.

468
00:30:52,12 --> 00:30:53,12
Come on!

469
00:31:05,62 --> 00:31:08,37
- Move!
- That's it. Let's go!

470
00:31:09,00 --> 00:31:10,04
All right, got it.

471
00:31:11,87 --> 00:31:14,08
Move, move! Move! Move!

472
00:31:14,25 --> 00:31:15,95
Keep moving! Keep moving.

473
00:31:16,16 --> 00:31:18,58
Go! Move around him! Move!

474
00:31:19,58 --> 00:31:20,58
Time check!

475
00:31:21,29 --> 00:31:22,29
Five-nine.

476
00:31:23,45 --> 00:31:24,58
Faster! Faster! Faster!

477
00:31:24,58 --> 00:31:26,91
Come on! Let's go! Come on!

478
00:31:38,66 --> 00:31:40,91
Watch yourselves!
It's a long way down!

479
00:32:07,25 --> 00:32:09,70
Almost home! Everyone can go home!

480
00:32:09,87 --> 00:32:10,95
Let's move!

481
00:32:10,95 --> 00:32:12,04
Move!

482
00:32:12,79 --> 00:32:13,83
Right, get it out! Out!

483
00:32:13,83 --> 00:32:16,70
What are you doing?
You're still loading?

484
00:32:16,70 --> 00:32:17,91
We have two minutes.

485
00:32:18,37 --> 00:32:20,20
I was afraid you'd be leaving!

486
00:32:20,20 --> 00:32:21,54
We need to be locking up!

487
00:32:22,70 --> 00:32:24,62
Easy there... Yeah...
Quickly, quickly...

488
00:32:29,00 --> 00:32:30,00
You.

489
00:32:30,00 --> 00:32:31,50
Quit gawking and get pushing.

490
00:32:31,50 --> 00:32:33,50
Close it down! Let's go! Last call!

491
00:32:33,66 --> 00:32:35,20
You'll hang for this.

492
00:32:35,87 --> 00:32:38,87
Seven years serving you?
I deserve worse than that.

493
00:32:39,41 --> 00:32:40,62
Are we good to go?

494
00:32:40,62 --> 00:32:41,70
We're good.

495
00:32:42,08 --> 00:32:43,29
Okay, come on! Come on!

496
00:33:02,62 --> 00:33:03,95
Are you crazy?

497
00:33:03,95 --> 00:33:06,16
Just leave it! Get this thing in the air!

498
00:33:07,20 --> 00:33:08,41
What's going on here?

499
00:33:15,45 --> 00:33:17,08
You're off your post, Corporal.

500
00:33:18,33 --> 00:33:19,33
Sorry, sir, but...

501
00:33:19,33 --> 00:33:22,08
This is a classified mission,
and you're not cleared to be here.

502
00:33:27,54 --> 00:33:28,54
Commandant?

503
00:33:29,33 --> 00:33:32,83
Tell him, sir. Tell him he needs to leave.

504
00:33:34,91 --> 00:33:35,91
Sir?

505
00:33:36,00 --> 00:33:37,83
I am giving you a direct order, Corporal!

506
00:33:37,83 --> 00:33:39,16
What is going on here?

507
00:33:39,25 --> 00:33:40,79
Sir...

508
00:34:00,25 --> 00:34:02,41
- Go and get us ready!
- Cover me!

509
00:34:02,50 --> 00:34:03,50
Now!

510
00:34:47,33 --> 00:34:48,58
I'm pinned down!

511
00:34:49,95 --> 00:34:50,95
Cover me!

512
00:35:00,79 --> 00:35:01,79
No!

513
00:35:30,37 --> 00:35:31,41
Where's Taramyn?

514
00:35:47,95 --> 00:35:49,66
Get this thing in the air!

515
00:35:49,75 --> 00:35:51,45
Go! Go! Go!

516
00:35:56,12 --> 00:35:57,41
Hang on!

517
00:36:21,08 --> 00:36:22,16
- No!
- Nemik!

518
00:36:25,95 --> 00:36:26,95
No! No! No!

519
00:36:29,12 --> 00:36:30,54
Lift him!

520
00:36:31,12 --> 00:36:33,87
I can't feel my legs. I can't,
I can't feel my legs.

521
00:36:35,25 --> 00:36:36,37
- Nemik.
- Hey.

522
00:36:36,37 --> 00:36:37,91
Nemik, can you hear me?

523
00:36:40,37 --> 00:36:41,50
Can you hear me?

524
00:36:42,50 --> 00:36:43,58
I need a flight path.

525
00:36:44,50 --> 00:36:45,70
He's hurt! Hold on!

526
00:36:47,20 --> 00:36:48,70
- What are you doing?
- Hold him still.

527
00:36:49,66 --> 00:36:50,66
What is that?

528
00:36:50,75 --> 00:36:53,16
- Med-spike. Keep him still.
- Go, go, go.

529
00:36:53,25 --> 00:36:54,25
No.

530
00:36:58,45 --> 00:37:00,70
Where am I heading? I need numbers!

531
00:37:00,70 --> 00:37:01,79
Hold on!

532
00:37:12,95 --> 00:37:14,16
I'm flying blind!

533
00:37:30,50 --> 00:37:31,50
Climb!

534
00:37:31,70 --> 00:37:33,87
Climb? Look out the window.

535
00:37:34,33 --> 00:37:37,70
Climb. Full climb now!

536
00:37:38,29 --> 00:37:39,87
What did you give him?

537
00:37:39,87 --> 00:37:41,04
I'm pegged here!

538
00:37:41,12 --> 00:37:42,83
I don't have the speed to make it!

539
00:37:42,83 --> 00:37:44,62
And now you want me to climb?

540
00:37:45,37 --> 00:37:46,79
Climb!

541
00:38:06,37 --> 00:38:07,50
Dive!

542
00:38:10,87 --> 00:38:14,66
Vector six-five-five-five-one.

543
00:38:14,91 --> 00:38:16,83
Full boost thrust on level!

544
00:38:22,58 --> 00:38:23,58
Come on!

545
00:39:20,50 --> 00:39:22,00
I need to know where we're going.

546
00:39:22,70 --> 00:39:23,83
Is he still with us?

547
00:39:24,70 --> 00:39:26,87
Yeah, you disappointed?

548
00:39:27,50 --> 00:39:28,62
That's not fair.

549
00:39:28,62 --> 00:39:29,79
Where are we heading?

550
00:39:29,87 --> 00:39:31,79
- She wants to bail on him.
- He's dying.

551
00:39:32,50 --> 00:39:33,50
You don't know that.

552
00:39:35,79 --> 00:39:38,29
There's a doctor.
We have it built into the contingency.

553
00:39:38,37 --> 00:39:40,29
She doesn't want to
jeopardize the mission.

554
00:39:40,91 --> 00:39:42,29
This kid, I mean,

555
00:39:42,83 --> 00:39:46,16
this kid is the reason that we are here.

556
00:39:47,25 --> 00:39:48,33
He's alive.

557
00:39:52,08 --> 00:39:53,91
How do we get to the doctor?

558
00:40:33,66 --> 00:40:34,95
You think he'll make it?

559
00:40:36,79 --> 00:40:37,83
He could get lucky.

560
00:40:41,45 --> 00:40:42,45
Yeah, luck.

561
00:40:44,79 --> 00:40:47,00
It drives the whole damn galaxy,
doesn't it?

562
00:40:56,08 --> 00:40:57,75
You wanna guess how much is in there?

563
00:41:04,29 --> 00:41:05,79
Eighty million, give or take.

564
00:41:09,70 --> 00:41:10,70
What'd you tell me?

565
00:41:11,41 --> 00:41:13,58
You wanna win and walk away.

566
00:41:14,95 --> 00:41:15,95
Well...

567
00:41:18,37 --> 00:41:19,58
forty million apiece.

568
00:41:22,04 --> 00:41:24,04
Don't tell me you haven't
thought about it.

569
00:41:25,37 --> 00:41:28,95
See, I can't fly the trawler,
but I do have a safe place we can hole up.

570
00:41:32,04 --> 00:41:34,70
Between the two of us,
we could be the winners here.

571
00:41:35,87 --> 00:41:37,45
So no rebellion for you?

572
00:41:37,66 --> 00:41:39,54
Oh, I'm a rebel. It's just, uh...

573
00:41:43,08 --> 00:41:44,41
me against everybody else.

574
00:41:47,54 --> 00:41:49,54
Where would that put me?

575
00:41:50,20 --> 00:41:53,08
Forty million credits is enough
for me to forget all about you.

576
00:41:55,70 --> 00:41:57,58
Your brother, with the orchard?

577
00:41:59,12 --> 00:42:00,29
I don't have a brother.

578
00:42:03,75 --> 00:42:06,16
So just leave them here?

579
00:42:06,25 --> 00:42:08,12
Don't play the high mind with me.

580
00:42:08,12 --> 00:42:10,41
You're not here to save
anybody but yourself.

581
00:42:12,58 --> 00:42:14,58
I saw it the first minute
you came into camp.

582
00:42:14,58 --> 00:42:16,45
You're like me, we were born in the hole,

583
00:42:16,45 --> 00:42:18,91
all we know is climbing
over somebody else to get out.

584
00:42:24,54 --> 00:42:27,29
There's a moon eight parsecs
from here with nobody home.

585
00:42:30,58 --> 00:42:32,25
Put that thing down,

586
00:42:32,25 --> 00:42:33,66
catch our breath,

587
00:42:34,62 --> 00:42:36,66
split up the winnings, and walk...

588
00:42:55,33 --> 00:42:57,58
Thank you. Thank you for trying.

589
00:43:12,66 --> 00:43:14,08
I did everything I could.

590
00:43:14,08 --> 00:43:15,16
It's not you, Doc.

591
00:43:15,45 --> 00:43:17,29
And it's not what you think, either.

592
00:43:17,37 --> 00:43:19,16
Oh, surprise me.

593
00:43:19,91 --> 00:43:22,33
I'll give you 30,000 credits
for the ship in the barn.

594
00:43:22,62 --> 00:43:23,75
That's twice what it's worth.

595
00:43:23,75 --> 00:43:24,83
Excuse me?

596
00:43:24,83 --> 00:43:25,91
Where's Skeen?

597
00:43:27,29 --> 00:43:29,45
Skeen! Skeen!

598
00:43:29,45 --> 00:43:30,54
He's dead.

599
00:43:32,75 --> 00:43:35,29
He wanted to take the money
and leave you here.

600
00:43:35,66 --> 00:43:36,66
He wouldn't do that.

601
00:43:38,95 --> 00:43:40,66
You're gonna have to think about that.

602
00:43:40,91 --> 00:43:42,41
You disgusting bastard.

603
00:43:43,37 --> 00:43:44,45
Taramyn warned me.

604
00:43:44,45 --> 00:43:47,70
I'm taking my cut.
The number I was promised.

605
00:43:49,08 --> 00:43:51,29
I'm leaving you the freighter
and what's inside.

606
00:43:52,41 --> 00:43:53,41
I did my job.

607
00:43:55,29 --> 00:43:56,29
I'm done.

608
00:43:57,16 --> 00:43:59,12
And I wouldn't stick around if I were you.

609
00:44:00,66 --> 00:44:02,04
Return this to your friend.

610
00:44:07,62 --> 00:44:08,62
Wait.

611
00:44:12,70 --> 00:44:13,95
Nemik's manifesto.

612
00:44:18,16 --> 00:44:19,58
He said to give this to you.

613
00:44:20,66 --> 00:44:21,66
I don't want it.

614
00:44:22,45 --> 00:44:23,45
He insisted.

615
00:44:50,50 --> 00:44:53,50
Don't get comfortable.
This is not a meeting.

616
00:44:54,87 --> 00:44:56,04
No one is going home.

617
00:44:56,41 --> 00:44:58,25
Tell your staff, tell your families.

618
00:44:59,45 --> 00:45:03,16
I want every Star Sector
and Planetary Emergency Retaliation plan

619
00:45:03,25 --> 00:45:06,54
in the building ready
for presentation by midnight.

620
00:45:06,66 --> 00:45:09,66
Senator Dhow's proposal
is both temperate and timely,

621
00:45:10,41 --> 00:45:13,41
far more reasoned and thoughtful
than the calls for decree

622
00:45:13,50 --> 00:45:15,12
we've been hearing from the other side.

623
00:45:15,95 --> 00:45:19,62
There will be a fact-finding commission
put in place this session,

624
00:45:20,16 --> 00:45:22,25
and it will prove

625
00:45:23,04 --> 00:45:27,62
that this is a boot to the throats
of all Ghormans,

626
00:45:28,08 --> 00:45:31,50
who've done nothing more than
request their basic rights.

627
00:45:32,87 --> 00:45:36,00
My bill assails the coarse
and blatant domination

628
00:45:36,00 --> 00:45:38,37
of a peaceful and faithful ally.

629
00:45:48,37 --> 00:45:49,79
<i>The blue is lovely.</i>

630
00:45:50,79 --> 00:45:52,12
It's a Devaron blue.

631
00:45:53,54 --> 00:45:55,29
There's an inscription on that one.

632
00:45:58,50 --> 00:46:00,08
In a language no one remembers.

633
00:46:00,08 --> 00:46:01,16
How sad.

634
00:46:02,37 --> 00:46:05,33
No, it's liberating.
You decide what it says.

635
00:46:06,29 --> 00:46:07,75
Your own secret language.

636
00:46:09,25 --> 00:46:10,70
Got anything from Aldhani?

637
00:46:12,45 --> 00:46:13,45
Excuse me?

638
00:46:13,79 --> 00:46:14,79
Aldhani.

639
00:46:16,58 --> 00:46:18,95
Big rebel attack last night.
It's all the news.

640
00:46:21,66 --> 00:46:22,91
I'll have to look.

641
00:46:24,16 --> 00:46:26,33
Maybe we have something in the back.

642
00:46:26,33 --> 00:46:28,50
Really? I was kidding.
