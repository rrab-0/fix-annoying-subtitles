1
00:00:25,58 --> 00:00:27,91


2
00:01:20,45 --> 00:01:22,58


3
00:01:40,04 --> 00:01:42,04


4
00:01:53,29 --> 00:01:56,00


5
00:02:01,58 --> 00:02:03,87


6
00:02:09,58 --> 00:02:10,58
Wait there.

7
00:02:11,62 --> 00:02:14,16
No weapons. No comms.

8
00:02:14,87 --> 00:02:18,12
No credit. No nonsense.

9
00:02:18,20 --> 00:02:19,20
In you go.

10
00:02:21,08 --> 00:02:22,95
Upstairs lounge is closed tonight.

11
00:02:23,04 --> 00:02:25,58


12
00:02:43,75 --> 00:02:45,08
You pay at the end.

13
00:02:49,12 --> 00:02:50,45
Don't even think about it.

14
00:02:51,54 --> 00:02:53,04
She'll send you home cryin'.

15
00:03:02,20 --> 00:03:03,79


16
00:03:05,66 --> 00:03:06,66
Welcome.

17
00:03:07,45 --> 00:03:08,54
Hello.

18
00:03:08,62 --> 00:03:09,70
Alone tonight?

19
00:03:10,37 --> 00:03:11,50
-Just me.
-Hmm.

20
00:03:12,04 --> 00:03:14,16
-Have you been with us before?
-First time.

21
00:03:14,25 --> 00:03:18,58
Well, you picked a great night.
It's sort of been quiet this evening.

22
00:03:18,66 --> 00:03:19,95
Excuse me.

23
00:03:20,45 --> 00:03:21,45
We were here first.

24
00:03:21,54 --> 00:03:23,83
Yeah, we've been waiting.
He just got here.

25
00:03:23,91 --> 00:03:25,29
Gani will help you.

26
00:03:25,75 --> 00:03:26,91
GUARD: I don't want Gani.

27
00:03:27,41 --> 00:03:28,58
Behave.

28
00:03:30,75 --> 00:03:32,91

-Oh, she's funny, ain't she?

29
00:03:34,50 --> 00:03:35,75
My apologies.

30
00:03:36,45 --> 00:03:37,91
You should take care of them.

31
00:03:38,00 --> 00:03:39,33
Why?

32
00:03:39,41 --> 00:03:40,54
It's a company town.

33
00:03:40,62 --> 00:03:42,50
Oh, they're just sentry guards.

34
00:03:42,58 --> 00:03:45,83
They like to play at being cops.
It's... It's annoying.

35
00:03:46,25 --> 00:03:48,16
-GANI: Hello, guys.
-Where were we?

36
00:03:48,25 --> 00:03:51,16
-You were telling me how quiet it was.


37
00:03:53,87 --> 00:03:55,79
Looking for something special tonight?

38
00:03:57,75 --> 00:04:01,16
A friend of mine said there was a girl
from Kenari working here.

39
00:04:01,25 --> 00:04:02,25
Kenari?

40
00:04:03,04 --> 00:04:05,08
It was a small Mid Rim system.

41
00:04:05,16 --> 00:04:06,41
I've heard of it.

42
00:04:07,91 --> 00:04:10,04
It's not your girlfriend or something,
is it?

43
00:04:10,12 --> 00:04:12,08
-I don't have a girlfriend.


44
00:04:12,91 --> 00:04:16,08
Are you from Kenari? Nostalgic, are we?

45
00:04:18,70 --> 00:04:20,29
Let me go and check on that for you.

46
00:04:26,33 --> 00:04:27,50
Is there something amusing?

47
00:04:29,33 --> 00:04:30,33
What?

48
00:04:30,41 --> 00:04:32,87
GUARD: You keep looking over here
like there's something funny.

49
00:04:34,08 --> 00:04:35,37
Definitely not.

50
00:04:36,04 --> 00:04:37,20
What does that mean?

51
00:04:39,87 --> 00:04:43,91
Oh, that is a hard look
for a little thing like you.

52
00:04:44,91 --> 00:04:46,83
Yeah, he's not laughing now, is he?

53
00:04:47,75 --> 00:04:51,20
There was a girl from Kenari,
but she left several months ago.

54
00:04:51,29 --> 00:04:53,87
We do have a lovely lady
here tonight from Tahina

55
00:04:53,95 --> 00:04:56,37
who's got those big dark eyes
you're looking for.

56
00:04:56,45 --> 00:04:59,79
This girl from Kenari,
any idea where she went?

57
00:05:00,91 --> 00:05:05,16
What are you? Seriously.
Boyfriend? Husband?

58
00:05:06,58 --> 00:05:08,45
 I'm looking for my sister.

59
00:05:11,54 --> 00:05:14,70
Well, whoever she is, she's not here.
She disappeared.

60
00:05:15,70 --> 00:05:17,37
People come and go.

61
00:05:17,45 --> 00:05:18,54
You should leave.

62
00:05:19,25 --> 00:05:20,54
What was her name?

63
00:05:21,66 --> 00:05:23,37
Nobody here gives their real name.

64
00:05:33,54 --> 00:05:35,00


65
00:05:39,20 --> 00:05:41,16



66
00:05:41,25 --> 00:05:43,54
DOORMAN: Whoa, whoa, whoa. Hang on there.

67
00:05:43,62 --> 00:05:45,91
No weapons. No comms.

68
00:05:46,00 --> 00:05:48,29
No credit. No nonsense.

69
00:05:56,50 --> 00:05:59,87
GUARD 2: Hey! Scrawno! Slow down.

70
00:06:00,50 --> 00:06:01,54
Slow down!

71
00:06:01,62 --> 00:06:03,79
GUARD: Stop! Stop right there!

72
00:06:04,79 --> 00:06:07,70
You're in Pre-Mor corporate zone.
You know that, right?

73
00:06:07,79 --> 00:06:11,54
GUARD 2: Employees are required
to present their IDs upon request.

74
00:06:13,33 --> 00:06:16,20
Oh, no, you didn't park
out past the causeway, did ya?

75
00:06:16,29 --> 00:06:18,95
GUARD: I sure hope not.
That's off-limits to visitors.

76
00:06:19,04 --> 00:06:20,16
We'd have to fine you.

77
00:06:20,25 --> 00:06:22,83
GUARD 2: Yeah, I mean, you know
about the visitor's curfew, right?

78
00:06:22,91 --> 00:06:24,83
GUARD: Yeah, we'd have
to impound your ride.

79
00:06:26,00 --> 00:06:27,00
GUARD 2: Tough break.

80
00:06:27,70 --> 00:06:29,12
GUARD: What if he swum over?

81
00:06:30,16 --> 00:06:31,91
You swim over, scrawno?

82
00:06:32,75 --> 00:06:34,25
GUARD 2: Yeah, he's not laughing anymore.

83
00:06:34,33 --> 00:06:37,08
If you've got Corpo ID,
now would be the time to pull it out.

84
00:06:37,16 --> 00:06:38,70
GUARD: Gonna have to see it, big stuff.

85
00:06:41,08 --> 00:06:42,16
GUARD 2: There you go.

86
00:06:44,95 --> 00:06:47,54
I got 300 credits in my coat pocket.

87
00:06:49,12 --> 00:06:51,66
GUARD: 
What are the chances on that?

88
00:06:51,75 --> 00:06:55,41
That is almost exactly what it costs
to cover the fine.

89
00:06:55,50 --> 00:06:59,04
The towing charge
and our personal processing fee.

90
00:06:59,12 --> 00:07:00,79
GUARD 2: Everybody's lucky night.

91
00:07:03,54 --> 00:07:05,12
GUARD: Let's have a look at it.

92
00:07:05,20 --> 00:07:06,29
I'm not moving.

93
00:07:07,87 --> 00:07:09,95
You want it, you take it and I walk away.

94
00:07:10,87 --> 00:07:12,62
I don't need any surprises.

95
00:07:13,20 --> 00:07:15,20


96
00:07:15,87 --> 00:07:16,87


97
00:07:18,45 --> 00:07:19,54
Have at it.

98
00:07:21,70 --> 00:07:22,87


99
00:07:27,79 --> 00:07:28,79


100
00:07:31,45 --> 00:07:32,62
No. Other pocket.

101
00:07:35,58 --> 00:07:36,79


102
00:07:38,04 --> 00:07:39,70


103
00:07:40,95 --> 00:07:41,95


104
00:07:43,58 --> 00:07:44,58


105
00:07:45,62 --> 00:07:46,91


106
00:07:49,45 --> 00:07:50,54
Tell me now.

107
00:07:51,70 --> 00:07:53,08
Tell me what to do!

108
00:07:54,25 --> 00:07:55,70
Let's hear it, boss!

109
00:07:56,83 --> 00:07:58,45
Get up. Get him up.

110
00:07:59,45 --> 00:08:00,45
Get him up!

111
00:08:01,29 --> 00:08:02,29
Move!

112
00:08:10,95 --> 00:08:13,41
 He's not breathing.

113
00:08:14,20 --> 00:08:16,66
-No.
-Verlo! Verlo!

114
00:08:17,50 --> 00:08:19,08
-He's faking.
-He's not!

115
00:08:19,95 --> 00:08:22,37
Verlo! 

116
00:08:27,00 --> 00:08:28,00
You killed him.

117
00:08:39,08 --> 00:08:40,91


118
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:42,25
You didn't mean it.

119
00:08:43,29 --> 00:08:44,29
He fell.

120
00:08:46,04 --> 00:08:47,79
We had a misunderstanding, and...

121
00:08:49,66 --> 00:08:51,04
We'll go in together.

122
00:08:53,29 --> 00:08:56,12
We played too hard in hitting,
and you didn't understand it.

123
00:08:57,33 --> 00:09:00,08
He tried to grab you, and...
and he fell, and he hit his head.

124
00:09:02,20 --> 00:09:03,37
We'll go in together.

125
00:09:04,08 --> 00:09:05,54
We'll tell them what happened.

126
00:09:07,37 --> 00:09:09,45


127
00:09:10,41 --> 00:09:12,04


128
00:09:22,20 --> 00:09:23,54


129
00:09:29,33 --> 00:09:31,20


130
00:09:58,87 --> 00:10:00,87


131
00:10:12,37 --> 00:10:13,58


132
00:10:13,66 --> 00:10:14,87


133
00:10:28,91 --> 00:10:30,20


134
00:10:32,95 --> 00:10:34,16


135
00:10:35,29 --> 00:10:36,75


136
00:10:37,29 --> 00:10:38,58


137
00:10:38,66 --> 00:10:40,91


138
00:11:10,83 --> 00:11:14,16
B2EMO: C-C-Cassian.
I brought what you t-t-told me.

139
00:11:15,45 --> 00:11:19,37
Cassian. Kassa. Kassa.

140
00:11:19,91 --> 00:11:21,95
Kassa! Kassa!

141
00:11:24,25 --> 00:11:26,41


142
00:11:26,50 --> 00:11:27,91


143
00:11:29,00 --> 00:11:31,16


144
00:11:45,87 --> 00:11:47,83


145
00:11:57,41 --> 00:11:59,62



146
00:12:01,87 --> 00:12:03,66


147
00:12:09,04 --> 00:12:10,87


148
00:12:12,29 --> 00:12:15,41


149
00:12:22,00 --> 00:12:23,33


150
00:12:31,41 --> 00:12:33,83



151
00:12:37,54 --> 00:12:39,08
B2EMO: But where were you?

152
00:12:39,16 --> 00:12:40,66
It's not important.

153
00:12:40,75 --> 00:12:43,04
If it's not important, why not tell me?

154
00:12:45,87 --> 00:12:46,87
Cassian?

155
00:12:46,95 --> 00:12:49,08
CASSIAN: Who came by the house last night?

156
00:12:49,16 --> 00:12:52,16
Jezzi and Femmi brought supper
and Maarva's medicine,

157
00:12:52,25 --> 00:12:54,62
and then Jezzi came back b-b-because...

158
00:12:54,70 --> 00:12:55,87
Anybody looking for me?

159
00:12:55,95 --> 00:12:58,58
B-B-Brasso. Brasso was looking for you.

160
00:12:58,66 --> 00:13:00,25
CASSIAN: What did you tell him?

161
00:13:03,08 --> 00:13:04,33
B2EMO: Maarva told him...

162
00:13:04,41 --> 00:13:05,50
Told him what?

163
00:13:06,37 --> 00:13:08,00
B2EMO: Pausing for data lag.

164
00:13:08,62 --> 00:13:09,79
Tell me what she said.

165
00:13:09,87 --> 00:13:11,83

-Bee!

166
00:13:13,00 --> 00:13:15,70
B2EMO: Maarva said you were out
ruining your health and reputation

167
00:13:15,79 --> 00:13:17,87
with friends of low character.

168
00:13:17,95 --> 00:13:20,04
She told him sooner or later
you were going to

169
00:13:20,12 --> 00:13:23,16
g-g-get yourself into trouble
you couldn't talk your way out of.

170
00:13:23,25 --> 00:13:24,50
Then she told Brasso that...

171
00:13:24,58 --> 00:13:25,58
Enough!

172
00:13:28,16 --> 00:13:29,33
Come here.

173
00:13:30,70 --> 00:13:32,87
Listen to me. It's important.

174
00:13:32,95 --> 00:13:36,50
I know it takes a lot of energy,
but can you make a lie for me?

175
00:13:36,58 --> 00:13:39,41
I can lie.
I have adequate power reserves.

176
00:13:39,50 --> 00:13:43,12
Don't tell anybody you saw me.
Don't tell anybody you know where I am.

177
00:13:44,66 --> 00:13:45,83
B2EMO: That's two lies.

178
00:13:45,91 --> 00:13:47,16
Let's have both.

179
00:13:47,95 --> 00:13:49,58
I will have to recharge at home.

180
00:13:50,62 --> 00:13:52,29
Take your time on the way back.

181
00:13:55,04 --> 00:13:56,37
I got to hurry.

182
00:13:56,45 --> 00:13:58,08
B2EMO: I can't come with you?

183
00:13:58,16 --> 00:14:00,20
Not now. I don't have time.

184
00:14:01,33 --> 00:14:02,33
I'm sorry.

185
00:14:03,45 --> 00:14:05,83
I'm late. Wait. What's this?

186
00:14:06,25 --> 00:14:07,50
Hold still. Hold still.

187
00:14:10,66 --> 00:14:11,75
Take your time.

188
00:14:17,25 --> 00:14:20,33


189
00:14:20,41 --> 00:14:22,62


190
00:14:39,12 --> 00:14:41,12


191
00:15:14,45 --> 00:15:15,87


192
00:15:19,29 --> 00:15:20,45
MAN 1: Let's get to it.

193
00:15:21,20 --> 00:15:23,87
MAN 2: Grab mine.
MAN 3: Yeah, grab those two now.

194
00:15:27,66 --> 00:15:28,91
Brasso will catch you up.

195
00:15:29,00 --> 00:15:30,00
Hey.

196
00:15:31,08 --> 00:15:32,25
You don't look so good.

197
00:15:32,66 --> 00:15:33,66
I'm fine.

198
00:15:34,20 --> 00:15:36,41
-I came by for you last night.
-Yeah, I know.

199
00:15:37,16 --> 00:15:38,45
What'd you do when you left?

200
00:15:38,54 --> 00:15:42,75
Uh, I was tired. I went home,
cleaned up a bit, and then I fell asleep.

201
00:15:43,33 --> 00:15:47,33
No. You came by for me,
but I wasn't there.

202
00:15:47,41 --> 00:15:50,41
So then you started home,
and you saw me at the Hotel Bridge.

203
00:15:50,50 --> 00:15:53,54
We decided we were thirsty,
and you wanted to go to Cavo's.

204
00:15:53,62 --> 00:15:57,29
But I said that was no good because
there's too many people there I owe money.

205
00:15:57,37 --> 00:15:58,37
You're serious?

206
00:15:58,45 --> 00:15:59,50
Yeah.

207
00:16:00,83 --> 00:16:02,04
Who's gonna be asking?

208
00:16:02,12 --> 00:16:03,83
So Cavo's was out.

209
00:16:03,91 --> 00:16:08,79
But then you remembered you still had
half a bottle of nog stashed at home.

210
00:16:08,87 --> 00:16:11,29
So we went there
and drank ourselves to sleep.

211
00:16:14,20 --> 00:16:16,75
Please. I really need this.

212
00:16:20,75 --> 00:16:23,58
You insulted my choice of beverage.

213
00:16:23,66 --> 00:16:26,45
As host and provider,
I was offended by this.

214
00:16:26,54 --> 00:16:27,58


215
00:16:27,66 --> 00:16:30,58
You failed to gauge
the depth of my irritation.

216
00:16:30,66 --> 00:16:32,75
You rose to make your point more vocally.

217
00:16:32,83 --> 00:16:35,50
I was helping you back into your chair
when you fell.

218
00:16:36,66 --> 00:16:38,66
You were gone when I woke up.

219
00:16:38,75 --> 00:16:40,75
You've come here now to apologize.

220
00:16:41,12 --> 00:16:42,20


221
00:16:42,83 --> 00:16:44,45
I accept your apology.

222
00:16:44,54 --> 00:16:46,16
RASHI: Hey, Brasso, let's go.

223
00:16:46,25 --> 00:16:49,25
Do me this.
Whatever this is, when it's done,

224
00:16:49,33 --> 00:16:52,29
pull your boots on and get to work.
You look like a wreck.

225
00:16:53,41 --> 00:16:54,83
I knew I could count on you.

226
00:16:54,91 --> 00:16:56,79
I'm not lending you any money.

227
00:16:56,87 --> 00:16:58,04
I knew that, too.

228
00:16:58,83 --> 00:17:01,79
Tell your mother she can afford
to put the heating on.

229
00:17:01,87 --> 00:17:03,45
It was freezing there last night.

230
00:17:04,41 --> 00:17:06,00
Make yourself useful.

231
00:17:17,70 --> 00:17:19,58


232
00:17:22,29 --> 00:17:25,00
This is quite the report.
This happened when?

233
00:17:25,08 --> 00:17:27,45
Last night, sir.
I knew you were leaving this morning,

234
00:17:27,54 --> 00:17:30,91
and I wanted to make sure you had
all the information before your departure.

235
00:17:31,00 --> 00:17:32,33
You've been very busy.

236
00:17:32,41 --> 00:17:33,91
Two men are dead, sir.

237
00:17:34,00 --> 00:17:35,16
Employees.

238
00:17:35,25 --> 00:17:38,29
If that's not worth staying up for,
then I'm not worthy of the uniform.

239
00:17:38,83 --> 00:17:40,91
Have you modified your uniform?

240
00:17:41,87 --> 00:17:43,70
Perhaps slightly.

241
00:17:43,79 --> 00:17:45,16
Pockets, piping, and...

242
00:17:45,25 --> 00:17:47,50
and some light tailoring.

243
00:17:50,16 --> 00:17:52,50
I know one of these men. Kravas.

244
00:17:52,58 --> 00:17:55,33
That's another reason I wanted this
to get immediate attention.

245
00:17:55,41 --> 00:17:57,66
He was a squad commander on Four.

246
00:17:57,75 --> 00:17:59,29
He's fallen a great deal since then.

247
00:17:59,37 --> 00:18:01,00
He was a Sentry Corporal here on One.

248
00:18:01,08 --> 00:18:02,20
No mystery there.

249
00:18:02,29 --> 00:18:04,25
He's lucky he wasn't killed years ago.

250
00:18:04,33 --> 00:18:06,70
One of the most unpleasant people
I've ever met.

251
00:18:06,79 --> 00:18:08,66
There's no suspect at this point?

252
00:18:08,75 --> 00:18:10,08
We have some excellent leads.

253
00:18:10,16 --> 00:18:13,50
"A human with dark features
asking about a Kenari girl

254
00:18:13,58 --> 00:18:15,79
"who might have been working
in the establishment."

255
00:18:15,87 --> 00:18:19,33
Are there no witnesses to the actual
crime? It's usually quite busy there.

256
00:18:19,41 --> 00:18:21,95
Apparently not.
This happened just outside the district,

257
00:18:22,04 --> 00:18:24,75
-at the plaza entrance to the causeway.
-I know.

258
00:18:24,83 --> 00:18:27,08
-There's an intersection...
-I said I know it.

259
00:18:27,16 --> 00:18:28,91
-Were they robbed?
-No, sir.

260
00:18:30,08 --> 00:18:31,33
Tough case.

261
00:18:32,37 --> 00:18:33,70
Bad timing.

262
00:18:34,50 --> 00:18:37,16
I'm sure that in several days,
with the proper resources,

263
00:18:37,25 --> 00:18:38,95
-I can bring this case to a...
-Stop!

264
00:18:39,45 --> 00:18:42,54
And I don't mean just the talking.
I mean stop.

265
00:18:45,29 --> 00:18:47,41
This case appears to bear
all the hallmarks

266
00:18:47,50 --> 00:18:50,45
of what I like to describe
as regrettable misadventure.

267
00:18:50,87 --> 00:18:51,87
Sir?

268
00:18:51,95 --> 00:18:54,00
Two dedicated Pre-Mor employees

269
00:18:54,08 --> 00:18:57,00
caught in the sad orbit
of a rare calamity.

270
00:18:57,62 --> 00:18:58,75
I don't understand.

271
00:18:58,83 --> 00:19:01,33
I want you to conjure a suitable accident.

272
00:19:01,41 --> 00:19:02,91
-But...
-And let's make sure

273
00:19:03,00 --> 00:19:06,29
it's on the far side of the plaza.
Let's get it outside the Leisure Zone.

274
00:19:06,37 --> 00:19:07,75
-But they were murdered.
-No.

275
00:19:07,83 --> 00:19:09,58
They were killed in a fight.

276
00:19:10,41 --> 00:19:12,87
They were in a brothel,
which we're not supposed to have,

277
00:19:12,95 --> 00:19:15,37
the expensive one,
which they shouldn't be able to afford,

278
00:19:15,45 --> 00:19:18,20
drinking Revnog,
which we're not supposed to allow.

279
00:19:18,29 --> 00:19:22,62
Both of them supposedly on the job,
which is a dismissible offense.

280
00:19:22,70 --> 00:19:25,41
They clearly harassed
a human with dark features

281
00:19:25,50 --> 00:19:27,45
and chose the wrong person to annoy.

282
00:19:29,04 --> 00:19:33,25
I suspect they died rushing
to aid someone in distress.

283
00:19:33,33 --> 00:19:35,58
Nothing too heroic.
We don't need a parade.

284
00:19:36,45 --> 00:19:38,58
They died being helpful.

285
00:19:38,66 --> 00:19:42,37
Something sad but inspiring
in a mundane sort of way.

286
00:19:47,08 --> 00:19:49,29
You look stricken, Deputy Inspector.

287
00:19:49,37 --> 00:19:51,83
Are you absorbing my meaning here?

288
00:19:52,54 --> 00:19:53,75
Trying, sir.

289
00:19:54,87 --> 00:19:56,37
When I said bad timing,

290
00:19:56,45 --> 00:19:59,91
I wasn't referring to the fact
that you spent all night worrying this.

291
00:20:00,00 --> 00:20:02,91
I meant that
I am on my way this very morning

292
00:20:03,00 --> 00:20:06,16
to an Imperial Regional Command review,

293
00:20:06,91 --> 00:20:10,00
where I'll be asked to make a report
about our crime rates,

294
00:20:10,50 --> 00:20:11,91
and the goal of that speech,

295
00:20:12,00 --> 00:20:15,25
should you ever be asked to deliver it,
is brevity.

296
00:20:15,75 --> 00:20:20,20
Minimizing the time the Empire spends
thinking about Preox-Morlana

297
00:20:20,29 --> 00:20:23,16
benefits our superiors and, by extension,

298
00:20:23,25 --> 00:20:26,87
everyone here
at the Pre-Mor Security Inspection team,

299
00:20:26,95 --> 00:20:30,33
which at the moment includes you.

300
00:20:32,25 --> 00:20:34,91
Don't put your feet on my desk
in my absence,

301
00:20:35,00 --> 00:20:37,91
and let's have an accident report waiting
when I get back.

302
00:20:51,70 --> 00:20:54,58
Yeah, tell him that 15,000
is the best he's gonna get.

303
00:20:54,66 --> 00:20:56,70


304
00:20:58,79 --> 00:21:00,00
She's in the yard.

305
00:21:01,50 --> 00:21:04,29

-Yes, Yes, we can do that.

306
00:21:17,54 --> 00:21:18,54


307
00:21:19,66 --> 00:21:20,66
WOMAN: I'm busy.

308
00:21:21,50 --> 00:21:22,50
I'll be quick.

309
00:21:27,16 --> 00:21:28,54
What?

310
00:21:28,62 --> 00:21:30,70
-Your friend.
-What friend?

311
00:21:30,79 --> 00:21:34,37
The one who buys. Your secret friend.
How fast can you reach him?

312
00:21:34,45 --> 00:21:35,54
What happened to you?

313
00:21:36,16 --> 00:21:37,16
I fell.

314
00:21:37,25 --> 00:21:39,04
On what? A jealous husband?

315
00:21:39,83 --> 00:21:41,33
I have something to sell.

316
00:21:41,41 --> 00:21:43,12
Don't we all?

317
00:21:43,20 --> 00:21:44,45
How soon could he be here?

318
00:21:44,54 --> 00:21:46,83
I was planning to reach out
at the end of the month.

319
00:21:48,33 --> 00:21:50,62
No. This would have to be now.

320
00:21:50,70 --> 00:21:52,54
Yeah, for what? For one item?

321
00:21:52,62 --> 00:21:55,87
No. That's not how it works.
I bundle things before I make contact.

322
00:21:55,95 --> 00:21:57,75
Bix. Bix. Come on.

323
00:22:00,62 --> 00:22:04,12
There's a Tac Corvette coming in this week
looking for scrap.

324
00:22:04,20 --> 00:22:06,45
I'm told there's a rack
of Imperial targeting units

325
00:22:06,54 --> 00:22:08,54
someone might forget to strip out.

326
00:22:08,62 --> 00:22:10,79
We'll get that, that thing you've got.

327
00:22:10,87 --> 00:22:12,12
Got a few Naval com-scans...

328
00:22:12,20 --> 00:22:13,79
-I can't wait that long.
-Why?

329
00:22:16,41 --> 00:22:17,66
What have you done?

330
00:22:19,08 --> 00:22:21,20
Your friend will want this piece.

331
00:22:21,29 --> 00:22:24,04
He'll come for this.
You said he wanted to meet me.

332
00:22:24,12 --> 00:22:25,12
So, what is it?

333
00:22:26,41 --> 00:22:27,58
What is it?

334
00:22:29,45 --> 00:22:32,66
I got an untraceable NS-9 Starpath unit.

335
00:22:32,75 --> 00:22:36,75
Vector crystals and Imperial seal
still intact.

336
00:22:36,83 --> 00:22:38,20
How long have you had that?

337
00:22:39,87 --> 00:22:40,87
I need to move it, Bix.

338
00:22:40,95 --> 00:22:42,41
-You've been hiding it.
-Saving it.

339
00:22:42,50 --> 00:22:44,37
I'm guessing it comes from one of my bids.

340
00:22:44,45 --> 00:22:46,70
-Guess again.
-Not your best move, Cassian.

341
00:22:50,25 --> 00:22:51,25
So, what?

342
00:22:52,08 --> 00:22:53,50
You want to call your guy or not?

343
00:22:53,58 --> 00:22:55,50
-Do you know how much that's worth?
-Yeah.

344
00:22:56,25 --> 00:22:59,12
Enough to get out of here,
lay low till things cool off.

345
00:22:59,20 --> 00:23:02,33
-I need to relocate for a while.
-You've been holding out on me.

346
00:23:02,41 --> 00:23:05,00
And you've been skimming off the top.


347
00:23:05,08 --> 00:23:06,91
So let's not get emotional.

348
00:23:10,12 --> 00:23:11,50
You'll need an alternative plan...

349
00:23:11,58 --> 00:23:14,33
-No, no. The answer's no.
-You don't know what I'm about to suggest.

350
00:23:14,41 --> 00:23:16,33
-I'm not selling this to you, Bix.
-Come on.

351
00:23:16,41 --> 00:23:18,25
I didn't hang on to this
to have a partner.

352
00:23:18,33 --> 00:23:20,25
I need every credit
I can put my hands on to...

353
00:23:20,33 --> 00:23:22,41
Are we bidding on the Wobani run tomorrow?

354
00:23:23,66 --> 00:23:24,66
What?

355
00:23:24,75 --> 00:23:27,87
There's a Wobani run coming.
Jeef wants to know if we're in on it.

356
00:23:29,12 --> 00:23:30,45
He'll know when I'm ready.

357
00:23:36,75 --> 00:23:39,25
 Yeah, are you...

358
00:23:39,83 --> 00:23:40,83
What?

359
00:23:40,91 --> 00:23:45,16
Well, it looks like it's turned
into something more than work.

360
00:23:45,25 --> 00:23:46,87
Do I ask about your personal life?

361
00:23:46,95 --> 00:23:49,95
Just promise he knows nothing
about any of this.

362
00:23:50,04 --> 00:23:51,70
He'd do anything for me.

363
00:23:52,66 --> 00:23:54,75
No. No, no. That wasn't my question.

364
00:23:56,45 --> 00:23:59,58
No. He knows nothing about any of it.

365
00:24:07,25 --> 00:24:09,50
Bix, you said he wanted to meet me.

366
00:24:10,58 --> 00:24:11,83
I really need this.

367
00:24:17,70 --> 00:24:18,70
I'll let him know.

368
00:24:23,79 --> 00:24:25,16
Now, go fix your face.

369
00:24:27,54 --> 00:24:31,20
Four of these, five of these.
Transport at once, once we get payment.

370
00:24:31,29 --> 00:24:32,58
WOMAN: Mm-hmm.

371
00:24:32,66 --> 00:24:34,00
She seems upset.

372
00:24:35,00 --> 00:24:36,33
It's good to see you, Timm.

373
00:24:36,41 --> 00:24:38,91
Seems like that happens
every time you come around.

374
00:24:39,00 --> 00:24:42,00
I wouldn't worry.
She's tougher than both of us.

375
00:24:42,08 --> 00:24:44,00
I'm getting tired of hearing that.

376
00:24:45,45 --> 00:24:48,62
Then you'd better find yourself
a less-complicated woman.

377
00:24:48,70 --> 00:24:49,83
Good luck with that.

378
00:24:51,79 --> 00:24:53,16


379
00:24:59,04 --> 00:25:01,04


380
00:25:01,75 --> 00:25:03,66


381
00:25:09,16 --> 00:25:11,37


382
00:25:19,16 --> 00:25:21,29


383
00:25:29,54 --> 00:25:30,54
GIRL: Kassa!

384
00:25:31,37 --> 00:25:33,62


385
00:25:38,75 --> 00:25:40,16


386
00:25:58,50 --> 00:26:00,04


387
00:26:10,50 --> 00:26:11,87


388
00:26:11,95 --> 00:26:14,29
Ey! 

389
00:26:19,37 --> 00:26:21,45


390
00:26:44,91 --> 00:26:47,20


391
00:26:49,08 --> 00:26:50,58
Everything okay, sir?

392
00:26:50,66 --> 00:26:51,79
Fine. 

393
00:26:52,70 --> 00:26:53,70
Thank you.

394
00:26:55,66 --> 00:26:56,91


395
00:26:57,00 --> 00:26:59,00


396
00:27:04,87 --> 00:27:05,87
Forward.

397
00:27:07,00 --> 00:27:08,29
 Forward.

398
00:27:09,45 --> 00:27:10,45
Forward.

399
00:27:11,50 --> 00:27:14,70
Wait. Wait, wait. Go back. Go back. That.

400
00:27:17,12 --> 00:27:18,20
What is that?

401
00:27:22,16 --> 00:27:24,33
I'm not quite sure, sir.

402
00:27:24,41 --> 00:27:25,75
Sublight something.

403
00:27:26,87 --> 00:27:30,58
Orlean Star Cab or a Dayvan.
Some old thing.

404
00:27:30,66 --> 00:27:33,41
And this something just strolls
through the checkpoint?

405
00:27:34,50 --> 00:27:37,75
No identification whatsoever,
just wanders into points unknown?

406
00:27:39,58 --> 00:27:42,37
The nights get busy. You know the traffic.

407
00:27:43,58 --> 00:27:45,08
I don't know what's more disturbing,

408
00:27:45,16 --> 00:27:48,41
the fact our borders are unprotected
or your complacence about it.

409
00:27:49,29 --> 00:27:52,66
Find it. Whatever it is, I want to know
when it left and where it went.

410
00:27:52,75 --> 00:27:54,83
You'd have to filter the entire night.

411
00:27:55,87 --> 00:27:58,12
Well, if it's too much for you,
let me know.

412
00:27:58,20 --> 00:27:59,70
I'm sure somebody wants the chair.

413
00:28:11,12 --> 00:28:12,58
-Hey, Cass.
-Hey. 

414
00:28:12,66 --> 00:28:14,08
-Good to see...
-What's the hurry?

415
00:28:14,16 --> 00:28:15,54
-Got some place to be?
-Yeah.

416
00:28:15,62 --> 00:28:17,20
What, not happy to see me?

417
00:28:17,29 --> 00:28:19,66
-What, no love for Nurchi?
-No, I'm late, okay?

418
00:28:19,75 --> 00:28:22,00
I know. I want my deposit back.

419
00:28:22,08 --> 00:28:25,04
I wish I could, but it's in play.

420
00:28:25,12 --> 00:28:27,08
Just waiting to hear they're on-site.
Okay?

421
00:28:29,75 --> 00:28:30,75
Vetch?

422
00:28:32,16 --> 00:28:33,16
Seriously?

423
00:28:33,25 --> 00:28:35,25
I'm not one of these losers
gonna let you float

424
00:28:35,33 --> 00:28:37,50
until they forget how much you owe them.

425
00:28:38,45 --> 00:28:39,70
You're here with him.

426
00:28:40,95 --> 00:28:41,95
To what?

427
00:28:42,45 --> 00:28:43,45
To threaten me?

428
00:28:45,29 --> 00:28:47,50
Vetch, you let him talk you into this?

429
00:28:47,58 --> 00:28:48,66
The subject is money.

430
00:28:48,75 --> 00:28:50,62
-I just asked you a question.
-What?

431
00:28:50,70 --> 00:28:52,66
Since when do you take orders from Nurchi?

432
00:28:52,75 --> 00:28:53,83
Don't answer that.

433
00:28:56,25 --> 00:28:58,91
-You need work this bad?
-Leave him out of it.

434
00:28:59,00 --> 00:29:01,83
He said all I needed to do was stand here.

435
00:29:02,45 --> 00:29:03,54
Good.

436
00:29:03,62 --> 00:29:04,75
You keep at it.

437
00:29:04,83 --> 00:29:06,12
You think I'm messing around?

438
00:29:06,20 --> 00:29:07,25
I hope so.

439
00:29:07,75 --> 00:29:10,41
I'm gonna do us a favor
and not mention this happened.

440
00:29:11,37 --> 00:29:13,29
Vetch, very nice to see you.

441
00:29:17,75 --> 00:29:18,75
What?

442
00:29:22,75 --> 00:29:23,75
I'll be back.

443
00:29:24,54 --> 00:29:27,45
-What's up?
-Errands. Won't be long.

444
00:29:33,16 --> 00:29:35,16


445
00:30:00,87 --> 00:30:01,91


446
00:30:02,00 --> 00:30:04,50



447
00:30:24,00 --> 00:30:25,62


448
00:30:38,45 --> 00:30:39,45
Dad.

449
00:30:41,20 --> 00:30:42,70
Haven't seen you lately.

450
00:30:42,79 --> 00:30:43,79
Some of us work.

451
00:30:44,04 --> 00:30:46,04
 What are we looking for?

452
00:30:47,04 --> 00:30:48,29
Bendine Mesh-Tech filter.

453
00:30:53,37 --> 00:30:54,45
Yellow racks in the back.

454
00:30:55,45 --> 00:30:56,79
You might have to dig a little.

455
00:30:57,54 --> 00:30:59,54
-Thanks.
-Good luck with it.

456
00:30:59,62 --> 00:31:01,87


457
00:31:28,70 --> 00:31:29,79


458
00:31:35,00 --> 00:31:37,00


459
00:31:40,25 --> 00:31:42,75


460
00:31:52,75 --> 00:31:54,50
Look alive. He's on his way up.

461
00:31:55,08 --> 00:31:56,75
Is he even allowed to approve overtime?

462
00:31:56,83 --> 00:31:58,75
-That's his problem.
-Not if we don't get it.

463
00:31:58,83 --> 00:32:00,79
Well, it'll be his name in the time scan.

464
00:32:00,87 --> 00:32:03,16
-Ferrix!
-Yes, sir, we've been working on it.

465
00:32:03,25 --> 00:32:05,37
Kenari human males on Ferrix.

466
00:32:05,45 --> 00:32:07,12
I'm afraid that's a blank, sir.

467
00:32:07,20 --> 00:32:08,20
What?

468
00:32:08,29 --> 00:32:09,83
But we have got a Imperial census.

469
00:32:09,91 --> 00:32:10,91
How old is it?

470
00:32:11,00 --> 00:32:12,29
This is six years ago.

471
00:32:12,37 --> 00:32:13,37
That's an eternity.

472
00:32:13,45 --> 00:32:16,08
There's not a lot about Kenari, sir.
It's fairly obscure.

473
00:32:16,16 --> 00:32:17,33
That should make it easier.

474
00:32:18,00 --> 00:32:19,29
We'll have to put the word out.

475
00:32:19,37 --> 00:32:21,37
-On Ferrix?
-Where else would we put it?

476
00:32:21,45 --> 00:32:23,08
We don't have presence there, sir.

477
00:32:23,16 --> 00:32:25,29
-Is it not under our jurisdiction?
-OFFICER 3: Technically.

478
00:32:25,37 --> 00:32:27,04
We are simply asking for information.

479
00:32:27,12 --> 00:32:29,75
-OFFICER 2: Have you ever been there?
-What difference does that make?

480
00:32:29,83 --> 00:32:31,79
They have their own way of doing things.

481
00:32:31,87 --> 00:32:34,54
This is the murder
of two Pre-Mor employees!

482
00:32:38,08 --> 00:32:39,08
Put out a bulletin.

483
00:32:39,16 --> 00:32:42,75
Kenari human men wanted for questioning.
Slam their channels. Flood it.

484
00:32:42,83 --> 00:32:45,20
Set up a desk here
to monitor anything that comes in.

485
00:32:46,45 --> 00:32:47,58
Let's go!

486
00:32:57,20 --> 00:32:59,16


487
00:33:01,16 --> 00:33:02,54


488
00:33:05,20 --> 00:33:06,54


489
00:33:21,58 --> 00:33:23,95
-What do you think you're doing?
-Forgot something.

490
00:33:24,04 --> 00:33:26,45
Now? He's in the office.

491
00:33:26,54 --> 00:33:30,41
I refueled it. Just like you told me.
And now I'm almost done.

492
00:33:30,91 --> 00:33:33,83
What is that? Is that the ID chip log?

493
00:33:33,91 --> 00:33:34,91
It's the old one.

494
00:33:35,91 --> 00:33:37,83
I'm just putting a blank in right now.

495
00:33:37,91 --> 00:33:39,08


496
00:33:39,16 --> 00:33:41,16
BOSS:  <i>Pegla! Pegla!</i>

497
00:33:41,25 --> 00:33:43,37
<i>What in the name of Chobb</i>
<i>is going on out there?</i>

498
00:33:45,95 --> 00:33:47,79
I think the yard rats are back.

499
00:33:47,87 --> 00:33:49,83
ZORBY: <i>There's a customer out front.</i>

500
00:33:49,91 --> 00:33:52,33
<i>Get those hounds</i>
<i>to start earning their keep.</i>

501
00:33:54,08 --> 00:33:57,20
Why are you swapping chip logs?
You're gonna get us both in trouble.

502
00:33:57,29 --> 00:33:59,62
I didn't like the way
it was running last night.

503
00:33:59,70 --> 00:34:01,20
So you're doing me a favor?

504
00:34:01,29 --> 00:34:03,00
Leave it better than you found it.

505
00:34:03,08 --> 00:34:04,25
The way you always do.

506
00:34:05,37 --> 00:34:06,41
The Cassian way.

507
00:34:07,87 --> 00:34:10,20
I was gonna ask if I could
borrow it again tomorrow.

508
00:34:10,29 --> 00:34:12,04
I wouldn't do that if I was you.

509
00:34:12,12 --> 00:34:13,62
Close this out.

510
00:34:13,70 --> 00:34:14,70
Don't come back.

511
00:34:14,79 --> 00:34:16,79
-Come on, Pegla.
-No, no, no.

512
00:34:18,00 --> 00:34:19,00
No.

513
00:34:19,08 --> 00:34:22,16
We're done. No more favors. No more deals.

514
00:34:22,25 --> 00:34:24,33
-Listen, this...
-Don't.

515
00:34:25,12 --> 00:34:27,75
I don't want to know
what you're doing or why

516
00:34:27,83 --> 00:34:30,45
or where you took this thing last night
or any of it.

517
00:34:30,54 --> 00:34:32,54
Finish up. Get out.

518
00:34:34,29 --> 00:34:35,29
Don't come back.

519
00:34:38,95 --> 00:34:40,87



520
00:34:47,91 --> 00:34:49,37


521
00:34:49,45 --> 00:34:51,87


522
00:35:06,00 --> 00:35:08,00


523
00:35:16,12 --> 00:35:17,12
GIRL: Kassa.

524
00:35:18,75 --> 00:35:19,75


525
00:35:23,37 --> 00:35:24,79


526
00:35:27,41 --> 00:35:29,41


527
00:35:48,66 --> 00:35:50,66
