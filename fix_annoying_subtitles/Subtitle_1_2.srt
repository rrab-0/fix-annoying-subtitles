1
00:00:01,00 --> 00:00:02,50


2
00:00:03,83 --> 00:00:08,04
No weapons. No comms.
No credit. No nonsense.

3
00:00:08,12 --> 00:00:11,20
CASSIAN: <i>A friend of mine said there</i>
<i>was a girl from Kenari working here.</i>

4
00:00:11,29 --> 00:00:12,70
 I'm looking for my sister.

5
00:00:12,79 --> 00:00:14,25
People come and go.

6
00:00:14,33 --> 00:00:15,37
You should leave.

7
00:00:16,37 --> 00:00:18,00
Wh... What was her name?

8
00:00:18,08 --> 00:00:19,50
Nobody here gives their real name.

9
00:00:19,58 --> 00:00:21,45
Excuse me. We were here first.

10
00:00:22,37 --> 00:00:26,00
Oh, that is a hard look
for a little thing like you.

11
00:00:26,08 --> 00:00:27,20
<i>Stop right there!</i>

12
00:00:27,29 --> 00:00:28,83



13
00:00:28,91 --> 00:00:30,04
KRAVAS: <i>He's not breathing.</i>

14
00:00:30,12 --> 00:00:31,29
You killed him.

15
00:00:33,00 --> 00:00:34,33
CHIEF HYNE: <i>You've been very busy.</i>

16
00:00:34,41 --> 00:00:35,70
Two men are dead, sir.

17
00:00:35,79 --> 00:00:36,79
Employees.

18
00:00:36,87 --> 00:00:40,04
If that's not worth staying up for,
then I'm not worthy of the uniform.

19
00:00:40,12 --> 00:00:42,79
I know one of these men.
He was a squad commander on Four.

20
00:00:42,87 --> 00:00:45,04
One of the most unpleasant people
I've ever met.

21
00:00:45,12 --> 00:00:47,75
-But they were murdered.
-No. They were killed in a fight.

22
00:00:47,83 --> 00:00:50,75
<i>They clearly harassed</i>
<i>a human with dark features</i>

23
00:00:50,83 --> 00:00:52,91
<i>and chose the wrong person to annoy.</i>

24
00:00:53,00 --> 00:00:55,62
-CASSIAN: I have something to sell.
-What?

25
00:00:55,70 --> 00:00:58,20
I got an untraceable NS-9 Starpath unit.

26
00:00:58,29 --> 00:00:59,75
<i>Your friend will want this piece.</i>

27
00:01:00,41 --> 00:01:01,41
What is that?

28
00:01:01,50 --> 00:01:05,12
Find it. Whatever it is, I want to know
when it left and where it went.

29
00:01:05,20 --> 00:01:06,25
Let's go!

30
00:01:06,33 --> 00:01:08,04
Kassa!

31
00:01:08,12 --> 00:01:09,16


32
00:01:09,25 --> 00:01:10,54


33
00:01:10,62 --> 00:01:12,08


34
00:01:43,25 --> 00:01:45,25


35
00:02:20,87 --> 00:02:23,87


36
00:02:23,95 --> 00:02:26,08


37
00:02:37,12 --> 00:02:39,12


38
00:02:50,95 --> 00:02:52,54


39
00:02:56,62 --> 00:02:57,62


40
00:03:08,62 --> 00:03:09,70


41
00:03:17,79 --> 00:03:19,79


42
00:03:32,79 --> 00:03:35,00


43
00:03:55,45 --> 00:03:57,87


44
00:04:01,75 --> 00:04:02,91


45
00:04:03,45 --> 00:04:04,58


46
00:04:06,25 --> 00:04:07,25


47
00:04:07,33 --> 00:04:09,37


48
00:04:15,54 --> 00:04:18,33


49
00:04:26,83 --> 00:04:28,50


50
00:04:30,04 --> 00:04:31,04


51
00:04:33,58 --> 00:04:34,66
Shut the door.

52
00:04:36,25 --> 00:04:38,70


53
00:04:38,79 --> 00:04:40,54
-Scram! Get out of it!


54
00:04:47,00 --> 00:04:50,41



55
00:04:52,91 --> 00:04:54,79


56
00:04:54,87 --> 00:04:56,66


57
00:05:28,50 --> 00:05:30,41


58
00:05:35,45 --> 00:05:36,45
TIMM: Everythin' okay?

59
00:05:36,91 --> 00:05:37,91


60
00:05:39,00 --> 00:05:40,04
Just tired.

61
00:05:41,54 --> 00:05:42,75
Too tired for a meal?

62
00:05:44,00 --> 00:05:45,04
Was that the plan?

63
00:05:45,91 --> 00:05:46,95
Could be.

64
00:05:48,20 --> 00:05:50,25
I thought we said one night a week.

65
00:05:50,33 --> 00:05:52,16
Let's, uh, start the week tonight.

66
00:05:52,79 --> 00:05:54,12
Let's do this. 

67
00:05:54,20 --> 00:05:58,29
Why don't we do something fun
tomorrow night?

68
00:05:58,37 --> 00:05:59,66
There's a plan.

69
00:05:59,75 --> 00:06:01,45
Just lock up the back.

70
00:06:01,54 --> 00:06:03,45
-I'll take care of all this.


71
00:06:03,66 --> 00:06:05,00
-Thank you.
-Yep.

72
00:06:12,95 --> 00:06:14,95


73
00:06:20,41 --> 00:06:23,95


74
00:06:36,37 --> 00:06:38,41


75
00:06:38,50 --> 00:06:39,95


76
00:06:40,70 --> 00:06:41,83
Don't you say a word.

77
00:06:41,91 --> 00:06:43,58

-MAARVA: I mean it.

78
00:06:46,16 --> 00:06:47,41
CASSIAN: There you are.

79
00:06:47,79 --> 00:06:48,79


80
00:06:49,12 --> 00:06:50,66
Don't you look comfortable.

81
00:06:51,95 --> 00:06:53,12
 Hey.

82
00:06:54,04 --> 00:06:55,50

-Hey, Bee.

83
00:06:55,58 --> 00:06:56,66


84
00:06:59,08 --> 00:07:00,25
Everything okay?

85
00:07:02,25 --> 00:07:03,70
Oh. Oh, this? 

86
00:07:03,79 --> 00:07:05,87
Oh, I need a wash. Uh... 

87
00:07:05,95 --> 00:07:09,00
I was helping Pegla
and tripped on a cable.

88
00:07:09,91 --> 00:07:12,08
-You've been busy.
-CASSIAN: Yeah.

89
00:07:12,16 --> 00:07:14,04
I ran into Brasso last night.

90
00:07:14,62 --> 00:07:15,66


91
00:07:15,75 --> 00:07:17,58
We had a lot to talk about.

92
00:07:17,66 --> 00:07:19,00
MAARVA: Mmm, sounds fascinating.

93
00:07:19,87 --> 00:07:21,41
I would have come home this morning,

94
00:07:21,50 --> 00:07:23,79
but everything I had going on
was over East.

95
00:07:24,54 --> 00:07:26,37
I've been trying to get back all day.

96
00:07:27,33 --> 00:07:29,04
I'm gonna go get cleaned up.

97
00:07:29,12 --> 00:07:30,37
Read it to him, Bee.

98
00:07:31,54 --> 00:07:32,54
Read what?

99
00:07:32,62 --> 00:07:34,54
B2EMO: I c-c-can speak now?

100
00:07:34,62 --> 00:07:35,70
 Read it.

101
00:07:35,79 --> 00:07:36,79


102
00:07:36,87 --> 00:07:39,62
"P-P-Pre-Mor Authority
is seeking a Kenari male resident

103
00:07:39,70 --> 00:07:41,20
"of Ferrix for questioning.

104
00:07:41,29 --> 00:07:43,41
"Citizens with any information
should contact

105
00:07:43,50 --> 00:07:46,87
"the Preox-Morlana Security HQ

106
00:07:50,50 --> 00:07:51,50
Who else knows?

107
00:07:52,20 --> 00:07:53,25
About what?

108
00:07:53,33 --> 00:07:54,75
-That you were born in Kenari.


109
00:07:54,83 --> 00:07:56,41
You don't want to hear what happened?

110
00:07:56,50 --> 00:07:59,04
Mmm-hmm, we'll get to that. But who knows?
Who have we told?

111
00:07:59,12 --> 00:08:00,12
I don't know. I...

112
00:08:00,20 --> 00:08:01,58
MAARVA: We have always said Fest.

113
00:08:01,66 --> 00:08:04,54
Every doc I've ever submitted
has always said you were born on Fest.

114
00:08:04,62 --> 00:08:06,20
Have you ever said anything
other than Fest?

115
00:08:06,29 --> 00:08:08,54
Officially, no.
I don't think so. But people, yes.

116
00:08:08,62 --> 00:08:09,66
-Who?
-Uh... And so did you.

117
00:08:09,75 --> 00:08:11,41
-Well, how many?
-CASSIAN: I don't know.

118
00:08:11,50 --> 00:08:13,29
It's not something
I've been keeping track of!

119
00:08:13,37 --> 00:08:15,45
-Well, everyone I've told is dead.


120
00:08:15,54 --> 00:08:16,87
That's ridiculous.

121
00:08:16,95 --> 00:08:19,25
-Jezzi. Sammo. Hmm?
-That's family.

122
00:08:19,33 --> 00:08:21,00
If we're making a list,
we're making a list.

123
00:08:21,08 --> 00:08:23,04
Well, it's all your women
that I'm worried about.

124
00:08:23,12 --> 00:08:25,66
-Oh, come on. Please. Stop. Stop!
-MAARVA: Femmi, Karla, Sondreen.

125
00:08:25,75 --> 00:08:27,62
-There are some names I don't even know!
-B-B-Bix.

126
00:08:27,70 --> 00:08:29,45
Bix has nothing to do with this!

127
00:08:29,54 --> 00:08:32,75
But then who told these
Pre-Mor bastards about Kenari?

128
00:08:35,70 --> 00:08:36,75
That would be me.

129
00:08:38,70 --> 00:08:40,91
Bix. B-B-Bix is l-l-looking for you.

130
00:08:41,00 --> 00:08:42,79
-What?
-Well, why would you do that?

131
00:08:42,87 --> 00:08:45,54
-When? When? When did she call? Just now?
-What? Tell me.

132
00:08:45,62 --> 00:08:48,00
-C-C-Comm fail. Your comms.
-Bee, where is she?

133
00:08:48,08 --> 00:08:49,41
-How did that come up?
-Come on.

134
00:08:49,50 --> 00:08:51,08
-Just forget that.
-Is she still in the yard?

135
00:08:51,16 --> 00:08:53,45
-MAARVA: What do they want?
-Bee? Wait!

136
00:08:55,16 --> 00:08:56,20
Bee, where is she?

137
00:08:56,29 --> 00:08:59,75
C-c-comms access throttle.
C-c-calculating reroute.

138
00:08:59,83 --> 00:09:00,95


139
00:09:01,04 --> 00:09:02,04

-Cassian.

140
00:09:03,58 --> 00:09:04,83
What have you done?

141
00:09:07,20 --> 00:09:08,20


142
00:09:09,29 --> 00:09:10,33
I messed up.

143
00:09:13,08 --> 00:09:14,08


144
00:09:14,75 --> 00:09:16,50


145
00:09:29,87 --> 00:09:31,08


146
00:09:31,16 --> 00:09:32,16


147
00:09:32,66 --> 00:09:34,37
Haven't been here in a while.

148
00:09:34,45 --> 00:09:36,12
I wasn't sure what was safe.

149
00:09:36,20 --> 00:09:37,50
CASSIAN: You saw the notice.

150
00:09:37,58 --> 00:09:38,75
What did you do?

151
00:09:40,70 --> 00:09:42,70
Two guys jumped me. It went too far.

152
00:09:42,79 --> 00:09:44,66
How far is too far?

153
00:09:45,33 --> 00:09:46,91
They were shaking me down.

154
00:09:47,58 --> 00:09:49,45
I wasn't looking for a fight.

155
00:09:50,50 --> 00:09:52,79
Listen, forget what I said this morning.

156
00:09:52,87 --> 00:09:54,25
I'll sell you the piece.

157
00:09:54,33 --> 00:09:56,25
I just need enough to get out of here.

158
00:09:57,29 --> 00:09:58,50
He's coming.

159
00:09:59,16 --> 00:10:00,50
The buyer's coming.

160
00:10:01,08 --> 00:10:03,70
It's too late to call him off.
He'll be here in the morning.

161
00:10:06,33 --> 00:10:07,33


162
00:10:07,83 --> 00:10:08,83
Hey.

163
00:10:09,58 --> 00:10:10,87
I won't forget this.

164
00:10:11,08 --> 00:10:12,75


165
00:10:17,08 --> 00:10:19,08


166
00:10:24,25 --> 00:10:25,25
You should go.

167
00:10:25,33 --> 00:10:26,50
Yeah. Okay.

168
00:10:28,66 --> 00:10:29,66


169
00:10:33,33 --> 00:10:34,45


170
00:10:47,12 --> 00:10:49,33


171
00:10:55,79 --> 00:10:58,95


172
00:11:00,16 --> 00:11:03,16


173
00:11:06,95 --> 00:11:09,08


174
00:11:16,12 --> 00:11:18,12
FEMALE OFFICER: You called him, right?

175
00:11:18,20 --> 00:11:20,00
MALE OFFICER: He's on his way up.

176
00:11:20,83 --> 00:11:24,41
Cassian Andor. This says he's from Fest.

177
00:11:24,50 --> 00:11:27,25
This was a tip call, right?
Probably someone messing with us.

178
00:11:27,70 --> 00:11:30,62
-I don't see Kenari here.
-Hold on. I have an image.

179
00:11:33,54 --> 00:11:36,54
"Insurrection,
destruction of Imperial property,

180
00:11:36,62 --> 00:11:38,16
"assault on Imperial soldier."

181
00:11:38,25 --> 00:11:40,91
Check the database.
See if it says anything about Kenari.

182
00:11:41,00 --> 00:11:42,04
We have a suspect?

183
00:11:42,12 --> 00:11:44,12
Not sure yet. We're about to get an image.

184
00:11:44,20 --> 00:11:46,20


185
00:11:53,41 --> 00:11:54,45


186
00:11:56,54 --> 00:11:57,54


187
00:12:10,66 --> 00:12:12,00


188
00:12:13,37 --> 00:12:14,45


189
00:12:22,29 --> 00:12:23,33


190
00:12:23,50 --> 00:12:25,04
Who is it?

191
00:12:25,12 --> 00:12:26,50
BIX: <i>Is it too late?</i>

192
00:12:31,37 --> 00:12:33,20



193
00:12:36,08 --> 00:12:37,29
Your light was on.

194
00:12:37,66 --> 00:12:38,87
I'm here.

195
00:12:38,95 --> 00:12:40,58
Yeah, I... I see that.

196
00:12:40,66 --> 00:12:44,58
Uh, no, I meant...
I meant, yes, it's not too late.

197
00:12:45,58 --> 00:12:46,66
I couldn't sleep.

198
00:12:49,87 --> 00:12:53,87
-But if it's not a good time, then...
-No. No. Not at all.

199
00:12:57,04 --> 00:12:58,04


200
00:13:00,70 --> 00:13:01,91
I'm just... I'm surprised.

201
00:13:03,75 --> 00:13:04,79
Good.

202
00:13:06,87 --> 00:13:08,50
Do you want something to drink or...

203
00:13:08,58 --> 00:13:10,16
No. I've had enough.

204
00:13:10,33 --> 00:13:11,33


205
00:13:14,00 --> 00:13:15,25


206
00:13:15,33 --> 00:13:16,37
You all right?

207
00:13:17,87 --> 00:13:18,95
I am now.

208
00:13:21,41 --> 00:13:22,41


209
00:13:44,25 --> 00:13:46,25


210
00:13:58,04 --> 00:14:00,62
-Sergeant Linus Mosk at your service, sir.


211
00:14:01,50 --> 00:14:03,50
Sorry to roust you
in the middle of the night.

212
00:14:03,58 --> 00:14:06,50
No, sir. Privilege, sir.
Got the brief on the ride in.

213
00:14:06,58 --> 00:14:08,00
I'd like to move on this quickly.

214
00:14:08,08 --> 00:14:11,29
We have a dangerous, mobile suspect
in a very serious crime.

215
00:14:11,37 --> 00:14:12,62
Couldn't agree more, sir.

216
00:14:12,70 --> 00:14:13,91
Tempo is crucial.

217
00:14:14,00 --> 00:14:16,33
Velocity in the service
of inspired leadership,

218
00:14:16,41 --> 00:14:17,95
is there a worthy substitute?

219
00:14:18,04 --> 00:14:19,20
I think not.

220
00:14:19,29 --> 00:14:22,33
It's one suspect.
How many men do you think we'd need?

221
00:14:22,41 --> 00:14:24,37
I'd say 12, sir, just to be prudent.

222
00:14:24,95 --> 00:14:26,58
Will you be suiting up with us, sir?

223
00:14:27,33 --> 00:14:29,91
-I think I should. Don't you?
-Absolutely, sir.

224
00:14:30,00 --> 00:14:32,04
Show of force. Boost morale.

225
00:14:32,75 --> 00:14:34,83
Nothin' like seein'
an officer on the line.

226
00:14:34,91 --> 00:14:36,54
-Excellent.
-SERGEANT MOSK: If I may, sir,

227
00:14:36,62 --> 00:14:38,66
hats off to you and Chief Inspector.

228
00:14:38,75 --> 00:14:41,54
Two men dead, line of duty, colleagues?

229
00:14:41,62 --> 00:14:42,95
-It's outrageous.
-Exactly!

230
00:14:43,04 --> 00:14:46,33
The thought of anything less than
full engagement on a case like this...

231
00:14:46,41 --> 00:14:47,66
Unconscionable, sir.

232
00:14:47,75 --> 00:14:50,58
-Dereliction of duty, at the minimum.
-It would be, wouldn't it?

233
00:14:50,66 --> 00:14:52,08
I've seen it, sir.

234
00:14:52,16 --> 00:14:53,29
Half measures.

235
00:14:53,91 --> 00:14:56,12
The take-it-slow, the wait-and-see.

236
00:14:56,20 --> 00:14:58,04
It's a plague on discipline.

237
00:14:58,12 --> 00:15:00,25
Face your men, yourself,
the rest of your life,

238
00:15:00,33 --> 00:15:02,91
knowing you did less
than everything you possibly could?

239
00:15:03,00 --> 00:15:05,16
I've been saying all along
we need a stronger hand

240
00:15:05,25 --> 00:15:07,04
with these affiliated planets.

241
00:15:07,83 --> 00:15:09,79
There's fomenting out there, sir.

242
00:15:10,83 --> 00:15:12,41
Pockets of fomenting.

243
00:15:13,08 --> 00:15:16,45
Corporate Tactical Forces
are the Empire's first line of defense,

244
00:15:16,54 --> 00:15:20,04
and the best way to keep
the blade sharp is to use it.

245
00:15:21,45 --> 00:15:22,79
So, well,

246
00:15:24,54 --> 00:15:25,58
thank you, sir.

247
00:15:26,75 --> 00:15:29,37
I'll pass along your kind words
to the Chief Inspector.

248
00:15:31,20 --> 00:15:32,25
Sir!

249
00:15:36,62 --> 00:15:38,62


250
00:15:43,75 --> 00:15:45,29


251
00:16:09,12 --> 00:16:10,12


252
00:16:10,20 --> 00:16:11,20


253
00:16:30,54 --> 00:16:32,54


254
00:16:56,75 --> 00:16:57,75


255
00:17:02,45 --> 00:17:03,45


256
00:17:04,37 --> 00:17:06,37


257
00:17:09,66 --> 00:17:10,66


258
00:17:10,75 --> 00:17:13,16


259
00:17:17,79 --> 00:17:19,20


260
00:17:29,37 --> 00:17:30,75


261
00:17:44,25 --> 00:17:46,58


262
00:17:47,95 --> 00:17:49,95


263
00:18:10,87 --> 00:18:11,87


264
00:18:18,29 --> 00:18:19,29


265
00:18:19,37 --> 00:18:20,75


266
00:18:29,54 --> 00:18:30,87
GIRL: Psst. Kassa.

267
00:18:37,62 --> 00:18:38,83


268
00:18:38,91 --> 00:18:40,91


269
00:18:45,75 --> 00:18:47,20
MAN: Optimize landing.

270
00:18:47,29 --> 00:18:49,20

00:19:11,50 --> 00:19:13,50

00:19:16,41 --> 00:19:18,20

00:20:02,08 --> 00:20:03,16


285
00:20:05,66 --> 00:20:07,20


286
00:20:10,12 --> 00:20:11,12


287
00:20:17,12 --> 00:20:18,12
Hey.

288
00:20:20,41 --> 00:20:21,66
What are you doing?

289
00:20:23,00 --> 00:20:24,00
Ah, couldn't sleep.

290
00:20:30,25 --> 00:20:31,83
 Tell me you have caf.

291
00:20:32,41 --> 00:20:33,91
Was just about to put it on.

292
00:20:36,37 --> 00:20:39,20
Can you open up the yard
for me this morning? 

293
00:20:39,58 --> 00:20:40,87
TIMM: Uh, sure.

294
00:20:41,00 --> 00:20:42,33


295
00:20:51,45 --> 00:20:52,50
You okay?

296
00:20:53,70 --> 00:20:56,58
Yeah. Yeah. Just, um... Just tired.

297
00:20:58,66 --> 00:20:59,83
What's up this mornin'?

298
00:21:01,08 --> 00:21:02,66
Just got a few errands to run.

299
00:21:03,50 --> 00:21:04,79
Won't be long.

300
00:21:11,50 --> 00:21:13,87
I'm sure I had some comms in here.

301
00:21:13,95 --> 00:21:15,87


302
00:21:16,25 --> 00:21:18,00

-It's crap.

303
00:21:18,08 --> 00:21:19,75
Why do we n-n-need comms?

304
00:21:21,08 --> 00:21:22,08
Here we go.

305
00:21:23,58 --> 00:21:25,37
You could just come and t-tell me.

306
00:21:25,91 --> 00:21:26,91


307
00:21:27,00 --> 00:21:29,25
You haven't been listening to me,
have you?

308
00:21:30,29 --> 00:21:32,08
You have to go away.

309
00:21:32,16 --> 00:21:33,16
And?

310
00:21:33,25 --> 00:21:34,83
You have c-c-credits for Maarva.

311
00:21:34,91 --> 00:21:38,00
You need to t-t-tell me
where you're hiding them.

312
00:21:38,08 --> 00:21:41,79
Because we don't want someone else
to find Maarva's credits, do we?

313
00:21:41,87 --> 00:21:43,08
I agree.

314
00:21:44,12 --> 00:21:45,25
You should stay.

315
00:21:45,83 --> 00:21:47,58
If I can bring them myself, I will.

316
00:21:47,66 --> 00:21:50,20
But if I can't, we need the comms, right?

317
00:21:51,20 --> 00:21:52,37
Bee...

318
00:21:52,45 --> 00:21:54,75
Going is a b-b-bad idea.

319
00:21:55,41 --> 00:21:58,41
You need to get back.
She's gonna wonder where you are.

320
00:21:58,50 --> 00:21:59,50
Come on.

321
00:22:00,25 --> 00:22:01,29
Go!

322
00:22:01,37 --> 00:22:02,50


323
00:22:12,16 --> 00:22:13,25
MAARVA: <i>Bee?</i>

324
00:22:15,12 --> 00:22:16,12
Bee?

325
00:22:17,29 --> 00:22:18,29


326
00:22:18,91 --> 00:22:19,91
Bee?

327
00:22:21,83 --> 00:22:25,50
If you've powered down back here again,
I'll be so upset with you.

328
00:22:26,25 --> 00:22:27,25


329
00:22:28,12 --> 00:22:29,12
Hmm.

330
00:22:34,33 --> 00:22:35,33


331
00:22:36,50 --> 00:22:38,50


332
00:22:50,50 --> 00:22:51,54
Mmm.

333
00:23:05,16 --> 00:23:07,16


334
00:23:09,83 --> 00:23:11,41


335
00:23:43,08 --> 00:23:44,08


336
00:24:17,16 --> 00:24:18,16


337
00:24:19,45 --> 00:24:20,50


338
00:24:25,87 --> 00:24:27,83


339
00:24:27,91 --> 00:24:30,33


340
00:24:32,75 --> 00:24:33,79


341
00:24:36,66 --> 00:24:37,70


342
00:24:37,79 --> 00:24:40,00


343
00:24:40,08 --> 00:24:42,20


344
00:24:42,91 --> 00:24:43,95


345
00:24:45,66 --> 00:24:48,12


346
00:24:48,20 --> 00:24:50,08


347
00:24:50,70 --> 00:24:52,79


348
00:24:54,79 --> 00:24:56,16


349
00:24:56,54 --> 00:24:57,95


350
00:25:00,04 --> 00:25:01,62


351
00:25:07,25 --> 00:25:09,75


352
00:25:36,58 --> 00:25:38,58


353
00:25:38,66 --> 00:25:40,70


354
00:25:41,37 --> 00:25:43,37


355
00:25:45,33 --> 00:25:46,70


356
00:25:46,79 --> 00:25:48,04
XANWAN:  You're wrong.

357
00:25:48,12 --> 00:25:49,20


358
00:25:49,29 --> 00:25:50,87
XANWAN:
It's the confidence that's irritating.

359
00:25:50,95 --> 00:25:53,50

-I am looking it up!

360
00:25:53,58 --> 00:25:55,70
Hey. Haven't seen you in a while.

361
00:25:55,79 --> 00:25:59,41
-You got a minute?
-I'm just... I'm looking up Kenari.

362
00:26:00,58 --> 00:26:01,58
What's that?

363
00:26:01,66 --> 00:26:03,87
Yeah. He never heard of it either.

364
00:26:03,95 --> 00:26:05,25


365
00:26:05,33 --> 00:26:08,00
"Kenari. Mid Rim.

366
00:26:08,08 --> 00:26:11,33
"Abandoned after
Imperial mining disaster."

367
00:26:11,41 --> 00:26:12,50


368
00:26:12,58 --> 00:26:13,91
Mining. Everyone died.

369
00:26:14,00 --> 00:26:17,87
"Abandoned and considered toxic.
Imperial prohibition."

370
00:26:17,95 --> 00:26:19,54


371
00:26:19,62 --> 00:26:21,54
No, no, there's no reward.

372
00:26:21,62 --> 00:26:23,58
Corporate enforcement
are looking for someone.

373
00:26:23,66 --> 00:26:25,33
You know anybody from Kenari?

374
00:26:25,62 --> 00:26:26,75


375
00:26:27,20 --> 00:26:28,58
What can I do for you?

376
00:26:28,66 --> 00:26:30,25
How much for a run to Tassar?

377
00:26:31,04 --> 00:26:32,50
-XANWAN: When?
-Today.

378
00:26:32,58 --> 00:26:34,20
What would we be picking up?

379
00:26:34,29 --> 00:26:36,00
Give me the price for not knowing.

380
00:26:37,37 --> 00:26:39,00
-Weight?
-Not important.

381
00:26:39,08 --> 00:26:40,37
-XANWAN: Explosive?
-No, no.

382
00:26:40,45 --> 00:26:42,83
-Does it talk?
-Give me a number, Xan.

383
00:26:43,54 --> 00:26:44,62
XANWAN: Nine hundred.

384
00:26:45,25 --> 00:26:47,16
 A real number.

385
00:26:47,25 --> 00:26:49,41
You want immediacy and discretion.

386
00:26:49,50 --> 00:26:50,91
That's an expensive combo.

387
00:26:51,00 --> 00:26:53,41
-I got 500.
-Well, you should plan more carefully.

388
00:26:53,50 --> 00:26:56,08
-Okay, let's split the difference.
-XANWAN: It's your choice.

389
00:26:56,16 --> 00:26:58,75
You want to go today
and have me keep my mouth shut?

390
00:26:58,83 --> 00:27:00,12
Seven's my floor.

391
00:27:02,66 --> 00:27:05,79
Okay, if it's seven,
you better be ready in an hour.

392
00:27:06,54 --> 00:27:07,75
Keep the engine running.

393
00:27:09,83 --> 00:27:11,16


394
00:27:11,25 --> 00:27:12,66
Will you let it go?

395
00:27:12,75 --> 00:27:15,41


396
00:27:16,83 --> 00:27:19,54


397
00:27:23,16 --> 00:27:25,08
SERGEANT MOSK: All right, gentlemen.

398
00:27:25,16 --> 00:27:27,00

-Cassian Andor.

399
00:27:27,08 --> 00:27:29,12
Not a recent image,
but the best we've got.

400
00:27:30,20 --> 00:27:33,16
He may not appear to be
a formidable opponent,

401
00:27:33,25 --> 00:27:36,08
but two of our men are dead
having made that mistake.

402
00:27:36,16 --> 00:27:37,16


403
00:27:37,66 --> 00:27:40,79
West Team will include
Deputy Inspector Karn and myself.

404
00:27:40,87 --> 00:27:43,91
We will endeavor to serve
the warrant and exfil rapidly.

405
00:27:44,00 --> 00:27:46,54
North and East Team
will take positions accordingly

406
00:27:46,62 --> 00:27:49,79
for a pincer movement
should the subject attempt to flee.

407
00:27:50,91 --> 00:27:53,83
Andor should be considered
armed and dangerous.

408
00:27:53,91 --> 00:27:55,95
We will have the element of surprise,

409
00:27:56,04 --> 00:27:59,41
but there should be no illusions
as to the risks involved.

410
00:28:00,00 --> 00:28:01,58
There may be some local residents

411
00:28:01,66 --> 00:28:05,04
who are less than enthused
with our presence.

412
00:28:05,12 --> 00:28:06,16


413
00:28:06,25 --> 00:28:08,33
You may remind them
that there's a Territorial Forum

414
00:28:08,41 --> 00:28:10,66
once a month where they are free
to make official complaints.

415
00:28:10,75 --> 00:28:13,00


416
00:28:14,54 --> 00:28:15,58
All yours, sir.

417
00:28:30,16 --> 00:28:31,62
Thank you for being here.

418
00:28:36,50 --> 00:28:38,00
There comes a time when the...

419
00:28:39,20 --> 00:28:43,75
the risk of doing nothing
becomes the greatest risk of all.

420
00:28:46,83 --> 00:28:49,12
This is one of those decisive moments,

421
00:28:49,20 --> 00:28:55,29
and I can't imagine a team
I'd rather share it with than all of you.

422
00:29:01,12 --> 00:29:03,45
There's no room for doubt
on the path to...

423
00:29:03,54 --> 00:29:04,54


424
00:29:05,58 --> 00:29:07,16
success... 

425
00:29:08,54 --> 00:29:11,20
and, uh, justice.

426
00:29:16,16 --> 00:29:17,25
Best of luck to us all.

427
00:29:20,54 --> 00:29:21,54


428
00:29:26,62 --> 00:29:27,62


429
00:29:33,29 --> 00:29:34,66
All right, then. Carry on.

430
00:29:37,12 --> 00:29:38,29
Well said, sir.

431
00:29:38,37 --> 00:29:39,45


432
00:29:40,29 --> 00:29:41,45
Inspiring.

433
00:29:41,54 --> 00:29:43,54


434
00:29:58,95 --> 00:30:00,12
WILLI: You believe this?

435
00:30:01,91 --> 00:30:03,00
Incredible, right?

436
00:30:03,58 --> 00:30:04,58
We're circling.

437
00:30:04,66 --> 00:30:06,00
We're stacked up.

438
00:30:07,58 --> 00:30:08,58
Crazy, right?

439
00:30:10,58 --> 00:30:12,20
We should be charging them.

440
00:30:13,75 --> 00:30:15,79
What'd they stick you to park your ship?

441
00:30:17,29 --> 00:30:18,37
Sixty credits.

442
00:30:18,45 --> 00:30:20,45
 Gutty, aren't they?

443
00:30:21,33 --> 00:30:23,33
Chargin' us to come and spend our money.

444
00:30:24,66 --> 00:30:26,33
They get you comin' and goin'.

445
00:30:28,58 --> 00:30:29,58
I'm old enough,

446
00:30:29,66 --> 00:30:32,87
I first came here,
you could drive in across the wasteland.

447
00:30:33,66 --> 00:30:35,04
They had a groundcarry.

448
00:30:35,12 --> 00:30:36,25
Drive right through.

449
00:30:37,33 --> 00:30:39,25
That was no bargain either.

450
00:30:39,33 --> 00:30:41,95
You'd make the round trip
and taste it a week later.

451
00:30:42,04 --> 00:30:43,04


452
00:30:43,33 --> 00:30:45,50
Just  nasty.

453
00:30:47,54 --> 00:30:48,58
Now it's this.

454
00:30:50,45 --> 00:30:51,66
What's your line?

455
00:30:53,79 --> 00:30:54,79
Rather not say?

456
00:30:55,91 --> 00:30:57,00
No need to explain.

457
00:30:57,95 --> 00:31:00,16
Who knows
who you're talking to these days.

458
00:31:01,04 --> 00:31:02,41
Me, I'm in propulsion.

459
00:31:02,50 --> 00:31:05,08
We do add-ons and boosters.

460
00:31:06,75 --> 00:31:09,45


461
00:31:10,70 --> 00:31:11,70
Mmm.

462
00:31:13,08 --> 00:31:14,50
Never changes, does it?

463
00:31:16,75 --> 00:31:17,95
You know what they say?

464
00:31:19,37 --> 00:31:20,37
No, what's that?

465
00:31:21,04 --> 00:31:23,54
If you can't find it here,
it's not worth finding.

466
00:31:25,45 --> 00:31:26,45


467
00:31:26,79 --> 00:31:28,87


468
00:31:40,37 --> 00:31:41,70
