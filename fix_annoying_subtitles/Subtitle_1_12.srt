1
00:00:01,58 --> 00:00:05,16
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?

2
00:00:08,62 --> 00:00:11,50
<i>Ferrix has been
hiding long enough.</i>

3
00:00:11,50 --> 00:00:13,45
<i>So now
you're taking on the Empire?</i>

4
00:00:13,45 --> 00:00:15,29
What's left to keep you here?

5
00:00:15,29 --> 00:00:16,37
The Rebellion.

6
00:00:16,37 --> 00:00:19,16
Did he tell you?
He's writin' a manifesto.

7
00:00:19,16 --> 00:00:20,87
You're my ideal reader.

8
00:00:26,16 --> 00:00:27,87
He said to give this to you.

9
00:00:27,87 --> 00:00:32,37
So, searching for a more
fluid banking situation, are we?

10
00:00:32,37 --> 00:00:33,70
What will it cost?

11
00:00:33,70 --> 00:00:36,37
I have a 14-year-old son.
I'd like to bring him with me.

12
00:00:36,37 --> 00:00:39,54
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?

13
00:00:39,54 --> 00:00:40,62
<i>An introduction.</i>

14
00:00:40,62 --> 00:00:43,00
<i>Your daughter's 13.
She'll soon come of age.</i>

15
00:00:43,00 --> 00:00:44,83
Don't tell me you're taking proposals.

16
00:00:44,83 --> 00:00:47,00
I'm in so much trouble, Vel.

17
00:00:47,00 --> 00:00:49,87
ISB knows Kreegyr's plan.
They'll be waiting for him.

18
00:00:49,87 --> 00:00:54,12
- You think it's worth losing Kreegyr?
- I did.

19
00:00:54,12 --> 00:00:55,37
<i>Calling about Andor.</i>

20
00:00:55,37 --> 00:00:56,83
<i>You wanted news if I had it.</i>

21
00:00:56,83 --> 00:00:58,04
Yes. Please, go on.

22
00:00:58,04 --> 00:01:00,58
<i>The mother.
She's passed away.</i>

23
00:01:00,58 --> 00:01:02,45
<i>He might show up at the funeral.</i>

24
00:01:02,45 --> 00:01:04,50
- <i>They just moved the body.</i>
- What happens now?

25
00:01:04,50 --> 00:01:08,00
<i>As a prominent citizen of Ferrix,
she rates a big send-off.</i>

26
00:01:08,00 --> 00:01:09,66
They'll want to close Rix Road.

27
00:01:09,66 --> 00:01:11,37
You're going to give them a permit.

28
00:01:11,37 --> 00:01:12,45
<i>Cass, I'm sorry.</i>

29
00:01:13,66 --> 00:01:14,70
<i>Your mother's dead.</i>

30
00:03:32,00 --> 00:03:33,00
You're here.

31
00:03:33,50 --> 00:03:35,33
Welcome. And just in time for dinner.

32
00:03:35,33 --> 00:03:36,66
I'll eat later.

33
00:03:36,66 --> 00:03:39,37
I want to get changed,
take a walk around the town.

34
00:03:39,37 --> 00:03:40,50
I'll pull an escort.

35
00:03:41,37 --> 00:03:42,58
No need.

36
00:03:42,58 --> 00:03:44,12
Corv will take me.

37
00:03:44,12 --> 00:03:45,54
Keep it small.

38
00:03:45,54 --> 00:03:46,75
As you wish.

39
00:04:16,62 --> 00:04:17,62
- Xan.
- Hey.

40
00:04:17,62 --> 00:04:20,04
Looked like you were wrapping up,
so I thought I'd wait.

41
00:04:20,04 --> 00:04:22,16
- How long you been here?
- I spoke to Cassian.

42
00:04:22,16 --> 00:04:24,29
- What?
- He called the shop.

43
00:04:24,29 --> 00:04:25,37
How?

44
00:04:25,37 --> 00:04:27,83
Picked up the old box line
and there he was.

45
00:04:27,83 --> 00:04:29,16
- Where?
- I don't know. I...

46
00:04:29,16 --> 00:04:30,62
- Where is he?
- He wouldn't say.

47
00:04:32,29 --> 00:04:33,41
Does he know about Maarva?

48
00:04:33,41 --> 00:04:34,54
Yeah, he does now.

49
00:04:35,50 --> 00:04:37,16
It was a very short conversation.

50
00:04:37,75 --> 00:04:40,45
- He asked about the funeral.
- Let's walk.

51
00:04:44,00 --> 00:04:45,95
- Who else knows this?
- No one.

52
00:04:45,95 --> 00:04:47,25
Keep it that way.

53
00:04:47,25 --> 00:04:48,58
Can't be too careful.

54
00:04:48,58 --> 00:04:50,87
They're watching Maarva's.
Could be anywhere.

55
00:04:50,87 --> 00:04:52,83
He'd be insane to come back now.

56
00:04:52,83 --> 00:04:54,41
I hope you told him that.

57
00:04:54,41 --> 00:04:56,58
Like I said, it was a very short call.

58
00:05:46,66 --> 00:05:50,00
I can't stop thinkin' about
this whole Maarva situation.

59
00:05:51,08 --> 00:05:53,29
Imagine losing you mother like this.

60
00:05:55,33 --> 00:05:56,70
I couldn't stand it.

61
00:05:57,62 --> 00:05:59,25
Not being there for your mom.

62
00:05:59,91 --> 00:06:03,91
Have Brasso place her stone,
just breaks your heart, right?

63
00:06:04,95 --> 00:06:06,29
You gotta feel for Cassian.

64
00:06:06,29 --> 00:06:07,58
I'd be losing my mind.

65
00:06:10,41 --> 00:06:11,41
Want another?

66
00:06:13,25 --> 00:06:14,33
Maybe just one.

67
00:06:19,45 --> 00:06:20,95
Why worry it though?

68
00:06:20,95 --> 00:06:22,66
It's not like he knows about it.

69
00:06:22,66 --> 00:06:25,33
Guarantee you,
he's got no idea what's going on.

70
00:06:25,33 --> 00:06:26,58
Bank on that.

71
00:06:26,58 --> 00:06:28,41
I wouldn't be so sure.

72
00:06:29,87 --> 00:06:30,87
Hey.

73
00:06:31,62 --> 00:06:33,08
You know something I don't?

74
00:06:33,08 --> 00:06:35,70
Do me a favor, keep it that way.

75
00:06:43,70 --> 00:06:44,70
Hey.

76
00:06:44,70 --> 00:06:46,00
We'll have another round.

77
00:08:02,66 --> 00:08:04,04
I thought you left without me.

78
00:08:04,95 --> 00:08:06,45
- Crossed my mind.
- Mmm.

79
00:08:06,70 --> 00:08:09,08
- I looked for you but, uh...
- I'm sure.

80
00:08:09,08 --> 00:08:11,25
Kloris, we'd like privacy, please.

81
00:08:11,25 --> 00:08:12,37
Ma'am.

82
00:08:12,79 --> 00:08:15,20
What now?

83
00:08:19,33 --> 00:08:20,66
You're gambling again.

84
00:08:22,54 --> 00:08:25,41
- Nonsense.
- And here, in Coruscant.

85
00:08:25,41 --> 00:08:26,79
That's ridiculous.

86
00:08:26,79 --> 00:08:29,20
Do you have any idea
how tired of this I am?

87
00:08:30,66 --> 00:08:31,91
 <i>It's a lie.</i>

88
00:08:31,91 --> 00:08:33,62
<i>It's total fantasy.
Who's telling you this?</i>

89
00:08:33,62 --> 00:08:35,33
- Please.
- No, I'm serious.

90
00:08:35,33 --> 00:08:36,41
Perrin, please.

91
00:08:36,41 --> 00:08:38,25
- Who is saying this?
- Just don't.

92
00:08:38,87 --> 00:08:41,25
We'll go back there, right now.
We'll put it to an end.

93
00:08:41,25 --> 00:08:44,37
We will not.
I've been shamed enough for one night.

94
00:08:45,75 --> 00:08:48,37
You can't live without a casino? Fine.

95
00:08:48,37 --> 00:08:53,95
You go to Canto Bight
and do whatever it is you need to do.

96
00:08:54,58 --> 00:08:55,58
But not here.

97
00:08:56,70 --> 00:08:57,70
You promised.

98
00:08:57,70 --> 00:09:00,25
- I've kept my promise!
- Keep your voice down.

99
00:09:00,25 --> 00:09:02,12
 <i>He can't hear me.</i>

100
00:09:03,54 --> 00:09:04,54
<i>This is wrong, Mon.</i>

101
00:09:04,54 --> 00:09:07,58
<i>This is people trying to take you down
by coming after me.</i>

102
00:09:10,54 --> 00:09:12,54
You tell me who's saying this
and I'll tell you why.

103
00:09:12,54 --> 00:09:14,08
Oh, please.

104
00:09:14,95 --> 00:09:16,33
Where would I get the money?

105
00:09:17,00 --> 00:09:19,08
That's the question
that scares me the most.

106
00:09:21,87 --> 00:09:23,54
Someone's lying to you.

107
00:09:24,66 --> 00:09:26,16
On that, we can agree.

108
00:09:45,62 --> 00:09:46,91
You're here.

109
00:09:48,87 --> 00:09:50,70
I couldn't remember
if I'd locked the door,

110
00:09:50,70 --> 00:09:52,50
if you'd even remember how to get here.

111
00:09:52,50 --> 00:09:54,75
- And here I am.
- I was on my way to pick you up.

112
00:09:54,75 --> 00:09:56,79
This guy I've been watching, he's ISB.

113
00:09:58,91 --> 00:10:00,45
{\an8}He's their guy in town.

114
00:10:00,45 --> 00:10:02,12
{\an8}His boss showed up tonight.

115
00:10:03,00 --> 00:10:04,33
Good to see you too.

116
00:10:08,62 --> 00:10:12,00
An ISB supervisor came in tonight.

117
00:10:12,00 --> 00:10:13,08
A woman.

118
00:10:13,75 --> 00:10:15,12
Here. Now.

119
00:10:15,12 --> 00:10:16,50
I was on my way to pick you up

120
00:10:16,50 --> 00:10:18,58
when they left the hotel
dressed like locals.

121
00:10:19,20 --> 00:10:21,25
I had to follow.

122
00:10:22,41 --> 00:10:23,83
They're getting ready, Vel.

123
00:10:24,58 --> 00:10:26,33
They must know Andor's coming.

124
00:10:27,41 --> 00:10:28,91
You did the right thing.

125
00:10:28,91 --> 00:10:30,37
We have to get there first.

126
00:10:31,41 --> 00:10:32,95
- I know.
- Everything depends on it.

127
00:10:32,95 --> 00:10:34,25
I said I know.

128
00:10:41,75 --> 00:10:43,20
Come away from the window.

129
00:11:30,91 --> 00:11:32,33
<i>Here's the thing, Cassian.</i>

130
00:11:32,33 --> 00:11:35,45
<i>The man who sees everything
is more blessed than cursed.</i>

131
00:11:36,50 --> 00:11:38,58
<i>Look at that. Here we go.</i>

132
00:11:38,58 --> 00:11:40,12
Stand back, let it drip.

133
00:11:42,66 --> 00:11:44,50
Look how quickly that's cleaned up.

134
00:11:44,50 --> 00:11:45,58
Hard to believe, right?

135
00:11:46,25 --> 00:11:47,33
Two minutes.

136
00:11:47,33 --> 00:11:48,62
No longer, no shorter.

137
00:11:50,75 --> 00:11:52,58
You know why
they don't make these anymore?

138
00:11:53,08 --> 00:11:55,58
'Cause they'd rather sell you
a brand new system at ten times the price.

139
00:11:55,58 --> 00:11:57,12
I mean, how many we got?

140
00:11:57,12 --> 00:11:58,66
60? 70 of them?

141
00:12:00,33 --> 00:12:01,33
Just sittin' there.

142
00:12:02,04 --> 00:12:04,37
Five hundred credits each.

143
00:12:04,95 --> 00:12:07,95
People don't look down
to where they should.

144
00:12:09,20 --> 00:12:11,54
They don't look down,
they don't look past the rust.

145
00:12:11,54 --> 00:12:12,79
<i>Not us though, eh?</i>

146
00:12:13,75 --> 00:12:16,16
<i>Eyes open, possibilities everywhere.</i>

147
00:12:17,20 --> 00:12:18,62
Just need to get this cleaned up

148
00:12:18,62 --> 00:12:20,95
before Maarva find us
doing this in the house.

149
00:12:47,08 --> 00:12:48,20
Who's there?

150
00:12:51,41 --> 00:12:53,33
- Cass?
- Pegla?

151
00:12:53,33 --> 00:12:54,58
Down, now!

152
00:12:57,33 --> 00:12:59,25
Huh.

153
00:13:00,58 --> 00:13:02,91
I don't believe it.

154
00:13:07,50 --> 00:13:08,50
Hey.

155
00:13:09,62 --> 00:13:10,62
I'm just...

156
00:13:11,20 --> 00:13:12,45
I'm so sorry.

157
00:13:12,45 --> 00:13:14,20
I loved your mom, I really did.

158
00:13:14,20 --> 00:13:15,54
I know.

159
00:13:16,20 --> 00:13:17,62
It's good to see ya.

160
00:13:18,29 --> 00:13:19,41
What are you doing here?

161
00:13:19,41 --> 00:13:21,66
Just keepin' an eye
on the place till we sell it.

162
00:13:21,66 --> 00:13:22,75
Sell it?

163
00:13:24,08 --> 00:13:25,95
Where's Bix?

164
00:13:27,33 --> 00:13:28,50
Where is she?

165
00:13:28,50 --> 00:13:30,29
Cass...

166
00:13:32,45 --> 00:13:33,45
Where is she?

167
00:13:37,45 --> 00:13:40,37
<i>"There will be times
when the struggle seems impossible.</i>

168
00:13:40,37 --> 00:13:41,54
<i>"I know this already.</i>

169
00:13:42,29 --> 00:13:43,91
<i>"Alone, unsure,</i>

00:13:43,91 --> 00:13:46,41

175

<i>"that they've already
enlisted in the cause.</i>

176
00:14:05,70 --> 00:14:09,33
<i>"Remember that the frontier
of the Rebellion is everywhere.</i>

177
00:14:09,33 --> 00:14:13,08
<i>"And even the smallest act of insurrection
pushes our lines forward.</i>

178

00:14:34,29 --> 00:14:35,62
<i>"And know this,</i>

187
00:14:35,62 --> 00:14:39,08
<i>"the day will come
when all these skirmishes and battles,</i>

188
00:14:39,75 --> 00:14:40,83
<i>"these moments of defiance</i>

189
00:14:40,83 --> 00:14:42,87
<i>"will have flooded the banks
of the Empire's authority</i>

190
00:14:42,87 --> 00:14:45,45
<i>"and then there will be one too many.</i>

191
00:14:45,45 --> 00:14:48,66
<i>"One single thing will break the siege.</i>

192
00:14:50,62 --> 00:14:51,79
<i>"Remember this.</i>

193
00:14:53,16 --> 00:14:54,16
<i>"Try."</i>

194
00:15:02,45 --> 00:15:04,95
We've loosened air traffic
as you requested.

195
00:15:04,95 --> 00:15:08,12
Pulled back our uniform patrols,
relaxed our curfew.

196
00:15:08,12 --> 00:15:10,66
We've baited the trap and opened the door.

197
00:15:10,66 --> 00:15:12,70
We've got recon units
prepped and positioned.

198
00:15:12,70 --> 00:15:14,83
I know you've got
your own sources out there.

199
00:15:14,83 --> 00:15:16,04
What time is the funeral?

200
00:15:16,04 --> 00:15:17,25
They asked for midday.

201
00:15:17,25 --> 00:15:18,70
We pushed it back two hours.

202
00:15:18,70 --> 00:15:20,79
They slow down a bit after lunch.

203
00:15:22,08 --> 00:15:23,25
And the funeral area?

204
00:15:23,25 --> 00:15:25,16
Right there. That's her box.

205
00:15:25,16 --> 00:15:27,79
We're allowing them
half of Rix Road for one block.

206
00:15:27,79 --> 00:15:29,87
We gave them a max of 30 people.

207
00:15:29,87 --> 00:15:32,66
The Daughters pushed back,
so we've upped it to 40.

208
00:15:32,66 --> 00:15:34,00
"Daughters"?

209
00:15:34,00 --> 00:15:35,41
The Daughters of Ferrix.

210
00:15:35,41 --> 00:15:36,62
It's a social club.

211
00:15:36,62 --> 00:15:38,37
Andor's mother was a past president.

212
00:15:38,37 --> 00:15:40,12
A local annoyance.

213
00:15:40,12 --> 00:15:42,66
The control position's here,
here, and here.

214
00:15:42,66 --> 00:15:45,20
We'll have snipers
and a containment unit there.

215
00:15:45,20 --> 00:15:46,75
Containment, yes. Snipers, no.

216
00:15:46,75 --> 00:15:48,37
I want him taken alive.

217
00:15:49,29 --> 00:15:51,58
I want that message passed along the line.

218
00:15:51,58 --> 00:15:52,95
And clearly.

219
00:16:22,58 --> 00:16:24,58
"Where would I get the money?"

220
00:16:24,58 --> 00:16:26,37
"That's what scares me the most."

221
00:16:26,37 --> 00:16:28,58
That's right. Word for word.

222
00:16:29,20 --> 00:16:32,75
Was she more angry about him lying
or the possibility of gambling debts?

223
00:16:32,75 --> 00:16:34,20
Hard to say.

224
00:16:34,20 --> 00:16:37,08
Mon Mothma is of great interest here.

225
00:16:37,08 --> 00:16:41,66
Having her husband dig a hole
for himself could be helpful in many ways.

226
00:16:41,66 --> 00:16:44,20
Well, it sounded like
Perrin had done this before.

227
00:16:45,00 --> 00:16:47,12
They've made some
odd banking moves recently.

228
00:16:47,12 --> 00:16:48,83
This would certainly explain it.

229
00:16:49,45 --> 00:16:51,16
Kreegyr. You're missing it.

230
00:16:56,16 --> 00:16:57,33
Keep listening.

231
00:17:05,29 --> 00:17:07,33
You can close out your Anto Kreegyr files.

232
00:17:08,20 --> 00:17:09,54
How many attacked?

233
00:17:09,54 --> 00:17:11,29
They're still counting the bodies.

234
00:17:12,00 --> 00:17:13,00
It's over?

235
00:17:13,00 --> 00:17:14,20
They walked right into it.

236
00:17:14,20 --> 00:17:15,75
It was over before they started.

237
00:17:16,83 --> 00:17:17,83
Prisoners?

238
00:17:18,20 --> 00:17:19,33
Not today.

239
00:17:19,33 --> 00:17:22,04
Take a guess who's not happy about that.

240
00:17:23,79 --> 00:17:24,83
She called in.

241
00:17:25,91 --> 00:17:27,12
He's been talking her down.

242
00:17:27,12 --> 00:17:30,33
 <i>I just wish
I had been part of the conversation, sir.</i>

243
00:17:30,33 --> 00:17:32,29
This wasn't a dialogue, Dedra.

244
00:17:32,29 --> 00:17:34,54
We get nothing from a dead body.

245
00:17:34,54 --> 00:17:37,04
Someone needs to be
in the room saying that.

246
00:17:37,04 --> 00:17:38,79
<i>You're missing the point.</i>

247
00:17:39,45 --> 00:17:43,66
Today was about wiping the taste
of Aldhani from the Emperor's mouth.

248
00:17:43,66 --> 00:17:45,45
You want to start a conversation?

249
00:17:46,45 --> 00:17:47,62
Find Axis.

250
00:18:47,25 --> 00:18:48,25
That's not him.

251
00:18:48,25 --> 00:18:50,16
 <i>Sir?</i>
The big man.

252
00:18:50,16 --> 00:18:51,29
We've been played.

253
00:18:51,87 --> 00:18:52,91
Where is he?

254
00:19:06,95 --> 00:19:09,16
Okay.

255
00:19:10,08 --> 00:19:11,33
Make it quick.

256
00:19:26,75 --> 00:19:28,25
I wanted her to leave with me.

257
00:19:28,25 --> 00:19:30,04
- I know.
- I came to get her.

258
00:19:30,04 --> 00:19:31,12
She told me.

259
00:19:33,33 --> 00:19:34,50
I couldn't get back.

260
00:19:34,50 --> 00:19:36,50
You shouldn't be here now, Cass.

261
00:19:38,25 --> 00:19:40,70
- But the last time I saw her, we argued.
- Don't.

262
00:19:40,70 --> 00:19:42,75
- I told her I was coming back.
- Stop.

263
00:19:42,75 --> 00:19:45,20
- I never should have left that morning.
- Stop.

264
00:19:46,79 --> 00:19:48,50
She told me you'd say all this.

265
00:19:53,70 --> 00:19:55,95
"Tell him, none of this is his fault.

266
00:19:56,79 --> 00:20:00,12
"It was already burning.
He's just the first spark of the fire.

267
00:20:01,12 --> 00:20:04,16
"Tell him,
he knows everything he needs to know

268
00:20:04,16 --> 00:20:06,20
"and feels everything he needs to feel.

269
00:20:07,70 --> 00:20:10,12
"And when the day comes,
and those two pull together,

270
00:20:10,12 --> 00:20:12,87
"he will be
an unstoppable force for good.

271
00:20:15,70 --> 00:20:16,91
"Tell him...

272
00:20:22,20 --> 00:20:25,04
"I love him more than anything
he could ever do wrong."

273
00:20:33,87 --> 00:20:35,75
- Hey.
- Who's that?

274
00:20:40,75 --> 00:20:43,20
There's different shifts
that they're taking.

275
00:20:45,79 --> 00:20:47,95
Street's clear. Hurry up.

276
00:20:49,87 --> 00:20:52,25
- Bix?
- Still got friends in the hotel.

277
00:20:52,25 --> 00:20:54,95
- She was alive three days ago.
- Why are they keeping her?

278
00:20:54,95 --> 00:20:56,83
She must know something.

279
00:20:57,95 --> 00:21:01,00
We can't just leave her there.

280
00:21:01,66 --> 00:21:03,29
You're gonna take on a full garrison?

281
00:21:04,79 --> 00:21:06,20
I'll take care of Maarva.

282
00:21:07,12 --> 00:21:08,79
You take care of yourself.

283
00:21:08,79 --> 00:21:10,37
It's too late for that.

284
00:22:27,04 --> 00:22:28,04
Any luck?

285
00:22:29,41 --> 00:22:30,45
Was getting worried.

286
00:22:32,00 --> 00:22:34,12
What's the verdict?
Has he come home or not?

287
00:22:34,12 --> 00:22:36,25
They seem to think so.
They're everywhere.

288
00:22:37,29 --> 00:22:40,29
- There's an ISB supervisor in town.
- A woman?

289
00:22:41,54 --> 00:22:42,54
You know her?

290
00:22:43,16 --> 00:22:44,16
Not yet.

291
00:22:44,75 --> 00:22:46,20
This is good.

292
00:22:46,20 --> 00:22:47,91
How is this possibly good?

293
00:22:47,91 --> 00:22:49,54
They'll do the hunting for us.

294
00:22:50,20 --> 00:22:51,25
They'll want him alive.

295
00:22:51,25 --> 00:22:52,95
They'll find him, we'll kill him.

296
00:22:53,91 --> 00:22:55,37
Where will they take him?

297
00:22:55,37 --> 00:22:56,58
The hotel.

298
00:22:56,58 --> 00:22:57,79
So that's our target.

299
00:22:58,91 --> 00:23:01,75
We just need him dead
before they start asking questions.

300
00:23:03,66 --> 00:23:05,83
How long do we have
before the festivities start?

301
00:23:05,83 --> 00:23:07,79
Few hours. You'll hear the anvil.

302
00:23:08,45 --> 00:23:10,37
- Where's Cinta?
- Watching the mother's house.

303
00:23:10,37 --> 00:23:12,37
Oh, forget that.
Get her up to the hotel.

304
00:23:12,37 --> 00:23:13,70
I'll have a look around.

305
00:23:19,04 --> 00:23:20,33
What's going on?

306
00:23:44,79 --> 00:23:46,66
Get Cinta. I'll be at the hotel.

307
00:24:13,91 --> 00:24:14,91
What's going on?

308
00:24:15,83 --> 00:24:16,83
I'm not sure.

309
00:24:45,58 --> 00:24:46,87
 <i>I can hear music, sir.</i>

310
00:26:07,45 --> 00:26:08,83
<i>Of course I hear it.</i>

311
00:26:10,58 --> 00:26:11,62
I'm just not seeing it.

312
00:26:12,70 --> 00:26:14,95
They've started.
They're coming from all over town.

313
00:26:14,95 --> 00:26:16,70
I want everything out here.

314
00:26:16,70 --> 00:26:18,33
Show of force immediately.

315
00:26:22,83 --> 00:26:24,29
Stand to!

316
00:26:24,29 --> 00:26:26,83
Double time, form up.

317
00:26:26,83 --> 00:26:28,04
Let's move!

318
00:26:50,12 --> 00:26:52,20
You call this a perimeter?

319
00:26:53,58 --> 00:26:55,54
Square this away!

320
00:26:55,54 --> 00:26:58,75
Get these people off the streets.

321
00:26:58,75 --> 00:27:00,12
Team one here.

322
00:27:00,12 --> 00:27:02,00
Team two here.
Go, go, go!

323
00:27:02,00 --> 00:27:03,29
Team three...

324
00:27:04,54 --> 00:27:06,29
Restrict them!

325
00:27:06,29 --> 00:27:09,04
Move! Move! Move!

326
00:27:11,16 --> 00:27:12,25
Go, go, go!

327
00:27:13,37 --> 00:27:15,29
Move! Move! Move!

328
00:27:18,16 --> 00:27:19,62
Take a unit down there.

329
00:27:21,70 --> 00:27:23,54
You, Captain, take them that way.

330
00:27:42,41 --> 00:27:44,37
- Double the reward.
- You found him?

331
00:27:44,37 --> 00:27:47,04
I want twice as much
and a ride out of here when it's over.

332
00:27:47,04 --> 00:27:49,00
- Where is he?
- Pretend you're arresting me.

333
00:27:49,00 --> 00:27:50,62
- Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?

334
00:27:50,62 --> 00:27:52,20
Hey. Move it. Move!

335
00:28:04,45 --> 00:28:06,29
Right,
we need to assume the positions.

336
00:28:06,29 --> 00:28:07,58
Secure the perimeter.

337
00:28:16,75 --> 00:28:18,29
Back!

338
00:28:39,75 --> 00:28:41,62
- Which building?
- Across the street.

339
00:28:41,62 --> 00:28:43,04
I need two men.
He's seen him?

340
00:28:43,04 --> 00:28:45,12
- No, but he's sure he's there.
- We're wasting time.

341
00:28:45,12 --> 00:28:47,12
I've got a recon unit
on the terrace up there now...

342
00:28:47,12 --> 00:28:48,58
No. I need him alive.

343
00:28:48,58 --> 00:28:50,66
Don't make me say it again.

344
00:29:49,95 --> 00:29:51,12
Sir.

345
00:29:51,12 --> 00:29:52,20
She's here.

346
00:29:53,16 --> 00:29:54,54
It's her.

347
00:30:58,20 --> 00:31:01,16
- What are we doing?
- We're wasting time.

348
00:31:40,62 --> 00:31:46,29
Stone and sky. Stone and sky...

349
00:31:58,70 --> 00:32:00,83
Stone and sky.

350
00:32:15,00 --> 00:32:17,20
- Tenek.
- Cassian.

351
00:32:17,20 --> 00:32:19,33
Where's Bix?

352
00:32:22,00 --> 00:32:23,41
I'm sorry about your mother.

353
00:32:40,95 --> 00:32:43,29
<i>My name is Maarva Carassi Andor.</i>

354
00:32:46,33 --> 00:32:48,79
<i>I'm honored to stand before you.</i>

355
00:32:50,87 --> 00:32:53,12
<i>I'm honored
to be a Daughter of Ferrix,</i>

356
00:32:54,25 --> 00:32:56,29
<i>and honored to be worthy of the stone.</i>

357
00:32:59,08 --> 00:33:00,12
<i>Strange, I...</i>

358
00:33:03,54 --> 00:33:05,00
<i>feel as if I can see it.</i>

359
00:33:09,04 --> 00:33:13,58
<i>I was six, I think,
first time I touched a funerary stone.</i>

360
00:33:15,91 --> 00:33:19,20
<i>Heard our music, felt our history.</i>

361
00:33:20,95 --> 00:33:24,66
<i>Holding my sister's hand as we walked
all the way from Fountain Square.</i>

362
00:33:26,45 --> 00:33:30,50
<i>Where you stand now,
I've been more times than I can remember.</i>

363
00:33:32,54 --> 00:33:34,41
<i>I always wanted to be lifted.</i>

364
00:33:36,75 --> 00:33:40,20
<i>I was always eager,
always waiting to be inspired.</i>

365
00:33:41,75 --> 00:33:46,37
<i>I remember every time it happened,
every time the dead lifted me...</i>

366
00:33:51,29 --> 00:33:52,50
<i>With their truth.</i>

367
00:33:59,37 --> 00:34:00,66
<i>And now I'm dead.</i>

368
00:34:03,41 --> 00:34:04,95
<i>And I yearn to lift you.</i>

369
00:34:06,25 --> 00:34:09,54
<i>Not because I want to shine
or even be remembered.</i>

370
00:34:10,50 --> 00:34:13,62
<i>It's because I want you to go on.</i>

371
00:34:14,41 --> 00:34:17,00
<i>I want Ferrix to continue.</i>

372
00:34:17,87 --> 00:34:21,75
<i>In my waning hours,
that's what comforts me most.</i>

373
00:34:23,04 --> 00:34:24,08
<i>But I fear for you.</i>

374
00:34:26,45 --> 00:34:27,50
<i>We've been sleeping.</i>

375
00:34:30,00 --> 00:34:34,16
<i>We've had each other,
and Ferrix, our work, our days.</i>

376
00:34:34,16 --> 00:34:36,37
<i>We had each other, and they left us alone.</i>

377
00:34:36,37 --> 00:34:40,20
<i>We kept the trade lanes open,
and they left us alone.</i>

378
00:34:41,66 --> 00:34:43,83
<i>We took their money and ignored them,</i>

379
00:34:43,83 --> 00:34:45,25
<i>we kept their engines churning,</i>

380
00:34:45,25 --> 00:34:47,95
<i>and the moment they pulled away,
we forgot them.</i>

381
00:34:49,95 --> 00:34:52,62
<i>Because we had each other.</i>

382
00:34:55,62 --> 00:34:56,62
<i>We had Ferrix.</i>

383
00:35:00,75 --> 00:35:01,87
<i>But we were sleeping.</i>

384
00:35:03,37 --> 00:35:04,41
<i>I've been sleeping.</i>

385
00:35:06,45 --> 00:35:09,58
<i>And I've been turning away from the truth
I wanted not to face.</i>

386
00:35:11,70 --> 00:35:15,54
<i>There is a wound that won't heal
at the center of the galaxy.</i>

387
00:35:16,58 --> 00:35:22,75
<i>There is a darkness reaching like rust
into everything around us.</i>

388
00:35:22,75 --> 00:35:24,62
<i>We let it grow, and now it's here.</i>

389
00:35:26,70 --> 00:35:30,66
<i>It's here, and it's not visiting anymore.</i>

390
00:35:32,87 --> 00:35:34,25
<i>It wants to stay.</i>

391
00:35:37,58 --> 00:35:42,33
<i>The Empire is a disease
that thrives in darkness,</i>

392
00:35:42,33 --> 00:35:45,66
<i>it is never more alive than when we sleep.</i>

393
00:35:50,16 --> 00:35:53,08
<i>It's easy for the dead
to tell you to fight,</i>

394
00:35:53,08 --> 00:35:56,12
<i>and maybe it's true,
maybe fighting is useless.</i>

395
00:36:00,20 --> 00:36:01,62
<i>Perhaps it's too late.</i>

396
00:36:05,58 --> 00:36:06,91
<i>But I'll tell you this...</i>

397
00:36:09,70 --> 00:36:11,33
<i>If I could do it again,</i>

398
00:36:12,20 --> 00:36:18,29
<i>I'd wake up early
and be fighting these bastards...</i>

399
00:36:18,29 --> 00:36:19,75
Move!

400
00:36:19,75 --> 00:36:22,50
<i>...from the start.</i>

401
00:36:23,75 --> 00:36:25,16
<i>Fight the Empire!</i>

402
00:36:25,16 --> 00:36:26,62
Enough!

403
00:36:32,75 --> 00:36:34,33
No!

404
00:36:38,16 --> 00:36:39,79
Placement!

405
00:36:56,12 --> 00:36:58,79
Let him through!
Hold the line!

406
00:36:58,79 --> 00:37:02,45
Let him through!

407
00:37:02,45 --> 00:37:04,45
Let him through.

408
00:37:04,45 --> 00:37:05,83
Hold the line!

409
00:37:07,08 --> 00:37:08,45
Hold the line!

410
00:37:13,66 --> 00:37:16,83
You! Bell tower, make it stop now!

411
00:37:16,83 --> 00:37:18,41
Go!

412
00:37:18,41 --> 00:37:19,83
Hold the line!

413
00:37:29,91 --> 00:37:31,29
I dreamt you came back.

414
00:37:33,04 --> 00:37:34,04
Bix?

415
00:37:35,54 --> 00:37:36,91
You climbed over a wall.

416
00:37:39,45 --> 00:37:43,45
Hey, listen, we gotta get outta here.

417
00:37:43,45 --> 00:37:45,04
Maarva was here.

418
00:37:49,50 --> 00:37:50,66
Wasn't she great?

419
00:38:00,75 --> 00:38:02,75
Get him up!

420
00:38:07,25 --> 00:38:10,25
Move, move!

421
00:38:15,04 --> 00:38:16,62
There's no one out there. Come on.

422
00:38:18,29 --> 00:38:19,37
They'll get angry.

423
00:38:21,62 --> 00:38:22,62
No.

424
00:38:50,79 --> 00:38:52,08
Ah!

425
00:39:17,12 --> 00:39:18,20
Oh, my God...

426
00:39:25,75 --> 00:39:27,50
Come. Come.

427
00:39:27,50 --> 00:39:28,75
There you go.

428
00:39:33,95 --> 00:39:35,70
Come on, let's get moving. Come on.

429
00:39:37,41 --> 00:39:38,41
Keep moving!

430
00:39:39,95 --> 00:39:41,50
There! That's him!

431
00:39:41,50 --> 00:39:42,70
Get him!

432
00:39:47,95 --> 00:39:50,25
- Hold the line!
- Open fire!

433
00:39:51,58 --> 00:39:53,75
Fire at will!

434
00:40:09,16 --> 00:40:10,95
Come on!

435
00:40:12,79 --> 00:40:14,04
- Move!
- Get him!

436
00:40:18,50 --> 00:40:20,37
Ah!

437
00:40:25,87 --> 00:40:27,04
Ah!

438
00:40:53,20 --> 00:40:54,87
You.

439
00:40:54,87 --> 00:40:57,54
What are you doing here?

440
00:41:26,58 --> 00:41:27,70
Okay.

441
00:42:38,62 --> 00:42:40,41
Do as I say. Move!

442
00:42:41,50 --> 00:42:43,12
Straight ahead. Through the door.

443
00:42:44,00 --> 00:42:45,45
Quickly!

444
00:42:49,70 --> 00:42:50,70
You?

445
00:42:51,91 --> 00:42:53,25
How?

446
00:42:54,83 --> 00:42:56,25
You were in trouble.

447
00:43:03,79 --> 00:43:04,79
Syril.

448
00:43:04,79 --> 00:43:05,91
I knew that.

449
00:43:14,16 --> 00:43:15,58
I should...

450
00:43:15,58 --> 00:43:17,16
I should say thank you.

451
00:43:19,29 --> 00:43:20,45
You don't have to.

452
00:43:45,91 --> 00:43:47,20
What about this?

453
00:43:47,20 --> 00:43:48,58
Everything goes.

454
00:43:48,58 --> 00:43:50,54
- Closet?
- Empty.

455
00:43:55,91 --> 00:43:57,62
- You're bleeding.
- It's fine.

456
00:43:57,62 --> 00:43:58,70
That's blood.

457
00:43:58,70 --> 00:43:59,79
It's nothing.

458
00:44:02,33 --> 00:44:03,62
It's not mine.

459
00:44:09,83 --> 00:44:11,12
Come on, guys.

460
00:44:11,12 --> 00:44:12,66
The fuel gauge says zero.

461
00:44:12,66 --> 00:44:14,20
I've got nothing.

462
00:44:15,12 --> 00:44:17,54
It's topped out. It's reading full.

463
00:44:18,12 --> 00:44:19,70
Do you wanna come up here and see?

464
00:44:19,70 --> 00:44:22,75
Bang the gauge, Jezz.
Just give it a whack.

465
00:44:24,58 --> 00:44:28,58
It's got a few kinks,
but it's a good old ship.

466
00:44:28,58 --> 00:44:30,50
I'd have more confidence
if you were coming.

467
00:44:32,45 --> 00:44:33,79
It flies.

468
00:44:35,58 --> 00:44:37,62
Pull it! Pull it!

469
00:44:39,58 --> 00:44:40,95
We're full!

470
00:44:44,70 --> 00:44:45,95
Give me those.

471
00:44:45,95 --> 00:44:49,00
Now, go.
You go now or forget it.

472
00:44:49,62 --> 00:44:50,79
No.

473
00:44:59,95 --> 00:45:01,41
C-C-Cassian.

474
00:45:02,70 --> 00:45:04,20
- Get it going!
- Almost there.

475
00:45:05,62 --> 00:45:07,45
Hey.

476
00:45:08,20 --> 00:45:10,37
- Help her up.
- Brasso.

477
00:45:11,04 --> 00:45:12,54
She's coming around. Come on.

478
00:45:13,75 --> 00:45:15,04
Let's get moving!

479
00:45:15,04 --> 00:45:17,29
Come. Come with me.

480
00:45:23,00 --> 00:45:24,58
- Hey, Jezz.
- Hey, Cass.

481
00:45:24,58 --> 00:45:26,25
Can they make it to Gangi Moon?

482
00:45:26,25 --> 00:45:27,83
If they ever make it out of here.

483
00:45:28,95 --> 00:45:29,95
You're not coming?

484
00:45:30,79 --> 00:45:32,87
Stay low all the way to Farside Sea.

485
00:45:32,87 --> 00:45:35,29
The moment you get over the water,
you climb.

486
00:45:36,04 --> 00:45:38,50
Straight home, full pump,
hand throttle, no comms.

487
00:45:39,50 --> 00:45:41,83
All in. You understand?

488
00:45:41,83 --> 00:45:43,16
Yeah.

489
00:45:43,16 --> 00:45:44,79
You're n-n-not coming?

490
00:45:45,37 --> 00:45:46,50
Not today, Bee.

491
00:45:46,50 --> 00:45:48,87
I n-n-never got to see you.

492
00:45:49,75 --> 00:45:52,12
You take care of Bix until I get there.

493
00:45:52,12 --> 00:45:53,25
I'm counting on you.

494
00:45:54,25 --> 00:45:55,66
You always say that.

495
00:45:56,87 --> 00:45:58,50
And you always come through.

496
00:45:59,87 --> 00:46:01,37
Get them out of here!

497
00:46:02,04 --> 00:46:03,16
He'll find us.

498
00:46:07,04 --> 00:46:08,41
Cassian will find us.

499
00:46:10,54 --> 00:46:12,58
I will.

500
00:46:20,41 --> 00:46:21,41
I'll find you.

501
00:46:23,33 --> 00:46:24,95
Now, go! Go, go!

502
00:47:59,54 --> 00:48:00,62
Prepare for evac.

503
00:48:00,62 --> 00:48:01,70
Full stealth.

504
00:48:25,95 --> 00:48:28,08
You came here to kill me, didn't you?

505
00:48:30,16 --> 00:48:31,37
You don't make it easy.

506
00:48:35,29 --> 00:48:36,37
I will now.

507
00:48:53,95 --> 00:48:55,33
What game is this?

508
00:48:57,62 --> 00:48:58,62
No game.

509
00:49:03,58 --> 00:49:04,58
Kill me.

510
00:49:08,20 --> 00:49:09,45
Or take me in.
