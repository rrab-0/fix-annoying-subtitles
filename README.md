# Fixes annoying (annoying for me at least) subtitles

(only works with .srt/.txt format, haven't tried on other formats yet)

Subtitles sometimes has _music intensifies_ which make sense for people with hard hearing

this python script removes them so no more _music intensifies_ to ruin your watching experience

to extract subtitle files from a .mkv file see https://qgustavor.github.io/mkv-extract/
